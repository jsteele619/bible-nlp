      "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\n",
      "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\n",
      "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\n",
      "And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.\n",
      "And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night: and the evening and the morning were the first day.\n",
      "And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\n",
      "And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.\n",
      "And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and the morning were the second day.\n",
      "And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\n",
      "And God called the dry land Earth, and the collection of waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good.\n",
      "And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.\n",
      "And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good.\n",
      "And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n",
      "And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.\n",
      "And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.\n",
      "And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.\n",
      "And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth.\n",
      "And to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.\n",
      "And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n",
      "And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.\n",
      "And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n",
      "And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.\n",
      "And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n",
      "And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.\n",
      "And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n",

      "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\n",
      "And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living animal that moveth upon the earth.\n",
      "And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.\n",
      "And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every animal that creepeth upon the earth, in which is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.\n",
      "And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\n",
      "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.\n",
      "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n",
      "And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.\n",
      "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.\n",
      "And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.\n",
      "But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.\n",
      "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n",
      "And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.\n",
      "And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n",
      "And a river went out of Eden to water the garden: and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.\n",
      "The name of the first is Pison, which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;\n",
      "And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx-stone.\n",
      "And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same that compasseth the whole land of Cush.\n",
      "And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: which floweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\n",
      "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.\n",
      "And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:\n",
      "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die.\n",
      "And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him a help meet for him.\n",
      "And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was its name.\n",
      "And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to every beast of the field: but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.\n",
      "And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.\n",
      "And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made woman, and brought her to the man.\n",
      "And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.\n",
      "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n",
      "And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.\n",
      "Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made: and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\n",
      "And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:\n",
      "But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.\n",
      "And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die:\n",
      "For God doth know, that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened: and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\n",
      "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise; she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.\n",
      "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked: and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made for themselves aprons.\n",
      "And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.\n",
      "And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where art thou?\n",
      "And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden: and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\n",
      "And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?\n",
      "And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.\n",
      "And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.\n",
      "And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field: upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:\n",
      "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\n",
      "To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\n",
      "And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;\n",
      "Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;\n",
      "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return.\n",
      "And Adam called his wife\\'s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.\n",
      "For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.\n",
      "And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:\n",
      "Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.\n",
      "So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\n",
      "And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.\n",
      "And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n",
      "And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.\n",
      "And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel, and to his offering:\n",
      "But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?\n",
      "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\n",
      "And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother\\'s keeper?\n",
      "And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother\\'s blood crieth to me from the ground.\n",
      "And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother\\'s blood from thy hand;\n",
      "When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength: A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\n",
      "And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.\n",
      "Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me will slay me.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\n",
      "And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.\n",
      "And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son Enoch.\n",
      "And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\n",
      "And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.\n",
      "And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.\n",
      "And his brother\\'s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.\n",
      "And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\n",
      "And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\n",
      "If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold.\n",
      "And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.\n",
      "And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.\n",
      "This is the book of the generations of Adam: In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him:\n",
      "Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.\n",
      "And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:\n",
      "And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:\n",

      "And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enos:\n",

      "That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all whom they chose.\n",
      "And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.\n",
      "There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them: the same became mighty men, who were of old, men of renown.\n",
      "And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n",
      "And the LORD repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.\n",
      "And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping animal, and the fowls of the air; for I repent that I have made them.\n",
      "But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\n",
      "These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.\n",
      "And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n",
      "The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence.\n",
      "And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt: for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\n",
      "And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them: and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.\n",
      "Make thee an ark of gopher-wood: rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.\n",
      "And this is the fashion in which thou shalt make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\n",
      "A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side: with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n",
      "And behold, I, even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven: and every thing that is on the earth shall die.\n",
      "But with thee will I establish my covenant: and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons\\' wives with thee.\n",
      "And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee: they shall be male and female.\n",
      "Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping animal of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come to thee, to keep them alive.\n",
      "And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.\n",
      "Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark: for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.\n",
      "Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.\n",
      "Of fowls of the air also by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.\n",
      "For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from the face of the earth.\n",
      "And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.\n",
      "And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.\n",
      "And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons\\' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\n",
      "Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every animal that creepeth upon the earth;\n",
      "There went in two and two to Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.\n",
      "And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.\n",
      "In the six hundredth year of Noah\\'s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n",
      "And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n",
      "In the same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah\\'s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.\n",
      "They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.\n",
      "And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which is the breath of life.\n",
      "And they that entered, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.\n",
      "And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth.\n",
      "And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth: and the ark moved upon the face of the waters.\n",
      "And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered.\n",
      "Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail: and the mountains were covered.\n",
      "And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:\n",
      "All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.\n",
      "And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping animals, and the fowl of heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth; and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\n",
      "And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.\n",
      "And God remembered Noah, and every living animal, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were checked.\n",
      "The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;\n",
      "And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.\n",
      "And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\n",
      "And the waters decreased continually, till the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:\n",
      "And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, till the waters were dried from off the earth.\n",
      "Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;\n",
      "But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark.\n",
      "And he stayed yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;\n",
      "And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was an olive-leaf plucked off: So Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.\n",
      "And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.\n",
      "And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.\n",
      "And God spoke to Noah, saying,\n",
      "Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons\\' wives with thee.\n",
      "Bring forth with thee every living animal that is with thee, of all flesh, of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.\n",
      "And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons\\' wives with him:\n",
      "Every beast, every creeping animal, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark.\n",
      "And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.\n",
      "And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man\\'s sake; for the imagination of man\\'s heart is evil from his youth: neither will I again smite any more every living animal as I have done.\n",
      "While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\n",
      "And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n",
      "And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth on the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.\n",
      "Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things:\n",
      "But flesh with the life of it, which is its blood, shall ye not eat.\n",
      "And surely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man\\'s brother will I require the life of man.\n",
      "Whoever sheddeth man\\'s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.\n",
      "And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply, bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.\n",
      "And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,\n",
      "And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;\n",
      "And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.\n",
      "And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.\n",
      "And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations.\n",
      "I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:\n",
      "And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.\n",
      "And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.\n",
      "And God said to Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\n",
      "And the sons of Noah that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham was the father of Canaan.\n",
      "These three were the sons of Noah: and from them was the whole earth overspread.\n",
      "And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:\n",
      "And he drank the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent.\n",
      "And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.\n",
      "And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father\\'s nakedness.\n",
      "And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him.\n",
      "And he said, Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren.\n",
      "And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n",
      "God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n",
      "And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\n",
      "And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah; Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and to them were sons born after the flood.\n",
      "The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\n",
      "And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n",
      "And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\n",
      "By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\n",
      "And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.\n",
      "And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha; and the sons of Raamah, Sheba, and Dedan.\n",
      "And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n",
      "He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.\n",
      "And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\n",
      "Out of that land went forth Ashur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,\n",
      "And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.\n",
      "And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim.\n",
      "And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.\n",
      "And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,\n",
      "And the Jebusite, and the Emorite, and the Girgasite,\n",
      "And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,\n",
      "And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites dispersed.\n",
      "And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, to Gaza; as thou goest to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lashah.\n",
      "These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.\n",
      "To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.\n",
      "The children of Shem; Elam, and Ashur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.\n",
      "And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\n",
      "And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.\n",
      "And to Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother\\'s name was Joktan.\n",
      "And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,\n",
      "And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah.\n",
      "And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,\n",
      "And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.\n",
      "And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest to Sephar, a mount of the east.\n",
      "These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.\n",
      "These are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.\n",
      "And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.\n",
      "And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.\n",
      "And they said one to another, come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.\n",
      "And they said, come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we should be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\n",
      "And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men were building.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\n",
      "Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another\\'s speech.\n",
      "So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.\n",
      "Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the LORD there confounded the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\n",
      "These are the generations of Shem: Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:\n",
      "And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah.\n",
      "And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:\n",
      "And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:\n",
      "And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:\n",
      "And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug.\n",
      "And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:\n",
      "And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah.\n",
      "And Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran: and Haran begat Lot.\n",
      "And Haran died before his father Terah, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.\n",
      "And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram\\'s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor\\'s wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.\n",
      "But Sarai was barren; she had no child.\n",
      "And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son\\'s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram\\'s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelt there.\n",
      "And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.\n",
      "Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father\\'s house, to a land that I will show thee:\n",
      "And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:\n",
      "And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\n",
      "So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed from Haran.\n",
      "And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother\\'s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.\n",
      "And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.\n",
      "And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.\n",
      "And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south.\n",
      "And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine was grievous in the land.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:\n",
      "Therefore it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.\n",
      "Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.\n",
      "The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh\\'s house.\n",
      "And he treated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.\n",
      "And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram\\'s wife.\n",
      "And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?\n",
      "Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me for a wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.\n",
      "And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.\n",
      "And Abram returned from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.\n",
      "And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n",
      "And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai;\n",
      "To the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.\n",
      "And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.\n",
      "And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.\n",
      "And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram\\'s cattle and the herdmen of Lot\\'s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.\n",
      "And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren.\n",
      "Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou wilt depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\n",
      "And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest to Zoar.\n",
      "Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.\n",
      "Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent towards Sodom.\n",
      "But the men of Sodom were wicked, and sinners before the LORD, exceedingly.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:\n",
      "For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.\n",
      "And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.\n",
      "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee.\n",
      "Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;\n",
      "That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.\n",
      "All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.\n",
      "Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.\n",
      "And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,\n",
      "And the Horites in their mount Seir, to El-paran, which is by the wilderness.\n",
      "And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.\n",
      "And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;\n",
      "With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.\n",
      "And the vale of Siddim was full of slime-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there: and they that remained fled to the mountain.\n",
      "And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.\n",
      "And they took Lot, Abram\\'s brother\\'s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.\n",
      "And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.\n",
      "And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan.\n",
      "And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.\n",
      "And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.\n",
      "And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king\\'s dale.\n",
      "And Melchisedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.\n",
      "And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:\n",
      "And blessed be the most high God, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.\n",
      "And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.\n",
      "And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,\n",
      "That I will not take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:\n",
      "Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.\n",
      "After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.\n",
      "And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?\n",
      "And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and lo, one born in my house is my heir.\n",
      "And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, This shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir.\n",
      "And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards heaven, and tell the stars, if thou art able to number them: and he said to him, So shall thy seed be.\n",
      "And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\n",
      "And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\n",
      "And he said, Lord GOD, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?\n",
      "And he said to him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.\n",
      "And he took to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds he did not divide.\n",
      "And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.\n",
      "And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.\n",
      "And he said to Abram, Know certainly that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;\n",
      "And also that nation which they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.\n",
      "And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.\n",
      "But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.\n",
      "In that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:\n",
      "The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,\n",
      "And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,\n",
      "And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\n",
      "Now Sarai, Abram\\'s wife, bore him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n",
      "And Sarai said to Abram, Behold, now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\n",
      "And Sarai, Abram\\'s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.\n",
      "And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n",
      "And Sarai said to Abram, my wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.\n",
      "But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.\n",
      "And he said, Hagar, Sarai\\'s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.\n",
      "And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man\\'s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.\n",
      "And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?\n",
      "Wherefore the well was called Beer-la-hai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.\n",
      "And Hagar bore Abram a son: and Abram called his son\\'s name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael.\n",
      "And Abram was eighty six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.\n",
      "And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.\n",
      "And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.\n",
      "And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,\n",
      "As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.\n",
      "Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.\n",
      "And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee; and kings shall proceed from thee.\n",
      "And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant; to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.\n",
      "And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\n",
      "And God said to Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee, in their generations.\n",
      "This is my covenant, which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee; Every male-child among you shall be circumcised.\n",
      "And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.\n",
      "And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male-child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who is not of thy seed.\n",
      "He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.\n",
      "And the uncircumcised male-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.\n",
      "And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\n",
      "And I will bless her, and give thee a son also by her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall proceed from her.\n",
      "Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?\n",
      "And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!\n",
      "And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.\n",
      "And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.\n",
      "But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year.\n",
      "And he ceased talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\n",
      "And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham\\'s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, in the same day, as God had said to him.\n",
      "And Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n",
      "And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n",
      "In the same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.\n",
      "And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;\n",
      "And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,\n",
      "And said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:\n",
      "Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:\n",
      "And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\n",
      "And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.\n",
      "And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and gave it to a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n",
      "And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.\n",
      "And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.\n",
      "And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time of life; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n",
      "Now Abraham and Sarah were old and far advanced in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n",
      "Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?\n",
      "Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\n",
      "Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n",
      "And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;\n",
      "Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n",
      "For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;\n",
      "I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.\n",
      "And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towards Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n",
      "And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\n",
      "Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are in it?\n",
      "That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n",
      "And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n",
      "And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I, who am dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the Lord.\n",
      "Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.\n",
      "And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty\\'s sake.\n",
      "And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there will thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\n",
      "And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord: Peradventure there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty\\'s sake.\n",
      "And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten\\'s sake.\n",
      "And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.\n",
      "And there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot seeing them, rose to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground;\n",
      "And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant\\'s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n",
      "And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.\n",
      "But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:\n",
      "And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.\n",
      "And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,\n",
      "And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n",
      "Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.\n",
      "And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one man came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to break the door.\n",
      "But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.\n",
      "And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\n",
      "And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:\n",
      "For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has become great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.\n",
      "And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Arise, depart from this place; for the LORD will destroy this city: but he seemed to his sons-in-law as one that mocked.\n",
      "And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n",
      "And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters: the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life: look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain: escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\n",
      "And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my Lord!\n",
      "Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me in saving my life: and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me, and I die:\n",
      "Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a small one: Oh, let me escape thither! (Is it not a small one?) and my soul shall live.\n",
      "And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for which thou hast spoken.\n",
      "Haste thee, escape thither: for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither: therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n",
      "The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n",
      "Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;\n",
      "And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.\n",
      "But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\n",
      "And Abraham rose early in the morning, to the place were he stood before the LORD:\n",
      "And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.\n",
      "And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he, and his two daughters.\n",
      "And the first-born said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:\n",
      "Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow that the first born said to the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n",
      "And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.\n",
      "And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.\n",
      "And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country, and dwelt between Kadash and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n",
      "And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister: And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.\n",
      "But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, on account of the woman whom thou hast taken: for she is a man\\'s wife.\n",
      "But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?\n",
      "Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart, and innocence of my hands have I done this.\n",
      "And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore I suffered thee not to touch her.\n",
      "Now therefore restore to the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou shalt not restore her, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.\n",
      "Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were greatly afraid.\n",
      "Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What has thou done to us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done.\n",
      "And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?\n",
      "And Abraham said, Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife\\'s sake.\n",
      "And yet indeed she is my sister: she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father\\'s house, that I said to her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show to me; At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.\n",
      "And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.\n",
      "And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.\n",
      "And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, to all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.\n",
      "So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore children.\n",
      "For the LORD had made barren all the females of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham\\'s wife.\n",
      "And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.\n",
      "For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.\n",
      "And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.\n",
      "And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him.\n",
      "And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.\n",
      "And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.\n",
      "And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah shall nurse children? for I have borne him a son in his old age.\n",
      "And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned.\n",
      "And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking.\n",
      "Wherefore, she said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman, and her son: for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.\n",
      "And the thing was very grievous in Abraham\\'s sight, because of his son.\n",
      "And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of thy bond-woman; in all that Sarah hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.\n",
      "And also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.\n",
      "And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar (putting it on her shoulder) and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.\n",
      "And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.\n",
      "And she went, and sat her down over against him, a good way off, as it were a bow-shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and raised her voice, and wept.\n",
      "And God heard the voice of the lad: and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.\n",
      "Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand: for I will make him a great nation.\n",
      "And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water: and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n",
      "And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.\n",
      "And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:\n",
      "Now therefore swear to me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son\\'s son: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou hast sojourned.\n",
      "And Abraham said, I will swear.\n",
      "And Abraham reproved Abimelech, because of a well of water, which Abimelech\\'s servants had violently taken away.\n",
      "And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet have I heard of it, but to-day.\n",
      "And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a covenant.\n",
      "And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.\n",
      "And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven ewe-lambs, which thou hast set by themselves?\n",
      "And he said, For these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have digged this well.\n",
      "Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba: because there they swore both of them.\n",
      "Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: Then Abimelech arose, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\n",
      "And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\n",
      "And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that God tempted Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.\n",
      "And he said, Take now thy son, thy only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to thee.\n",
      "And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and cleft the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose and went to the place which God had named to him.\n",
      "Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.\n",
      "And Abraham said to his young men, Abide you here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and return to you.\n",
      "And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife: and they went both of them together.\n",
      "And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?\n",
      "And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering: so they went both of them together.\n",
      "And they came to the place which God had named to him; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order; and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\n",
      "And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing to him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld from me thy son, thy only son.\n",
      "And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.\n",
      "And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it will be seen.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time,\n",
      "And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only son:\n",
      "That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;\n",
      "And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.\n",
      "So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children to thy brother Nahor;\n",
      "Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,\n",
      "And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n",
      "And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah bore to Nahor Abraham\\'s brother.\n",
      "And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n",
      "And Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.\n",
      "And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n",
      "And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,\n",
      "I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.\n",
      "And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,\n",
      "Hear us, my lord; thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead: none of us will withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.\n",
      "And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.\n",
      "And he communed with them, saying, If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,\n",
      "That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession of a burying-place among you.\n",
      "And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, of all that entered the gates of his city, saying,\n",
      "Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I to thee, and the cave that is in it, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to thee: bury thy dead.\n",
      "And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land.\n",
      "And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field: take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.\n",
      "And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,\n",
      "My lord, hearken to me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\n",
      "And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.\n",
      "And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure\n",
      "To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that entered the gate of his city.\n",
      "And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the field, and the cave that is in it were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, by the sons of Heth.\n",
      "And Abraham was old and far advanced in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.\n",
      "And Abraham said to his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:\n",
      "And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell:\n",
      "But thou shalt go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.\n",
      "And the servant said to him, It may be the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring thy son again to the land from whence thou camest?\n",
      "And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again.\n",
      "The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father\\'s house, and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.\n",
      "And if the woman shall not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only bring not my son thither again.\n",
      "And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.\n",
      "And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; (for all the goods of his master were in his hands:) and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.\n",
      "And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water, at the time of the evening, the time when women go out to draw water:\n",
      "And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, prosper me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.\n",
      "Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:\n",
      "And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and by that shall I know that thou hast shown kindness to my master.\n",
      "And it came to pass before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham\\'s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n",
      "And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.\n",
      "And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water from thy pitcher.\n",
      "And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.\n",
      "And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, till they have done drinking.\n",
      "And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.\n",
      "And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous, or not.\n",
      "And it came to pass as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ear-ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;\n",
      "And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father\\'s house for us to lodge in?\n",
      "And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.\n",
      "She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.\n",
      "And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD.\n",
      "And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left my master destitute of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master\\'s brethren.\n",
      "And the damsel ran, and told these things to her mother\\'s house.\n",
      "And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.\n",
      "And it came to pass when he saw the ear-ring and bracelets upon his sister\\'s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and behold, he stood by the camels at the well.\n",
      "And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; why standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.\n",
      "And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men\\'s feet that were with him.\n",
      "And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.\n",
      "And he said, I am Abraham\\'s servant.\n",
      "And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly, and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses.\n",
      "And Sarah, my master\\'s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old: and to him hath he given all that he hath.\n",
      "And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n",
      "But thou shalt go to my father\\'s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.\n",
      "And I said to my master, It may be the woman will not follow me.\n",
      "And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father\\'s house.\n",
      "Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.\n",
      "And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou dost prosper my way which I go:\n",
      "Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;\n",
      "And she saith to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath pointed out for my master\\'s son.\n",
      "And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew water: and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee.\n",
      "And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.\n",
      "And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor\\'s son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the ear-ring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.\n",
      "And I bowed my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master\\'s brother\\'s daughter for his son.\n",
      "And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.\n",
      "Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak to thee bad or good.\n",
      "Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master\\'s son\\'s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that when Abraham\\'s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.\n",
      "And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.\n",
      "And they ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.\n",
      "And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n",
      "And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master.\n",
      "And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.\n",
      "And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.\n",
      "And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham\\'s servant, and his men.\n",
      "And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.\n",
      "And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\n",
      "And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.\n",
      "And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels were coming.\n",
      "And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.\n",
      "For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail and covered herself.\n",
      "And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n",
      "And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah\\'s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother\\'s death.\n",
      "Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.\n",
      "And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.\n",
      "And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim and Leummim.\n",
      "And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\n",
      "And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.\n",
      "But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he yet lived) eastward, to the east country.\n",
      "And these are the days of the years of Abraham\\'s life which he lived, a hundred and seventy five years.\n",
      "Then Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;\n",
      "The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\n",
      "And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac: and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham\\'s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah\\'s handmaid, bore to Abraham.\n",
      "And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,\n",
      "And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,\n",
      "Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:\n",
      "These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.\n",
      "And these are the years of the life of Ishmael; a hundred and thirty and seven years: and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest towards Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.\n",
      "And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham\\'s son: Abraham begat Isaac:\n",
      "And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.\n",
      "And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n",
      "And the children struggled together within her: and she said, If it is so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels: and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.\n",
      "And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.\n",
      "And the first was born red, all over like a hairy garment: and they called his name Esau.\n",
      "And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold on Esau\\'s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.\n",
      "And the boys grew: and Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents.\n",
      "And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.\n",
      "And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.\n",
      "And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\n",
      "And Jacob said, Sell to me this day thy birth-right.\n",
      "And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?\n",
      "And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birth-right to Jacob.\n",
      "Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way: thus Esau despised his birth-right.\n",
      "And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt: dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.\n",
      "Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee, and to thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father;\n",
      "And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:\n",
      "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\n",
      "And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:\n",
      "And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.\n",
      "And it came to pass when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.\n",
      "And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I should die on her account.\n",
      "And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done to us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us.\n",
      "And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold: and the LORD blessed him:\n",
      "And the man became great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:\n",
      "For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and very many servants: And the Philistines envied him.\n",
      "For all the wells which his father\\'s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.\n",
      "And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us: for thou art much mightier than we.\n",
      "And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.\n",
      "And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.\n",
      "And Isaac\\'s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.\n",
      "And the herdmen of Gerar contended with Isaac\\'s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.\n",
      "And they digged another well, and contended for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.\n",
      "And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they did not contend: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.\n",
      "And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham\\'s sake.\n",
      "And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac\\'s servants digged a well.\n",
      "Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.\n",
      "And Isaac said to them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?\n",
      "And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;\n",
      "That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.\n",
      "And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.\n",
      "And they rose betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.\n",
      "And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac\\'s servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said to him, We have found water.\n",
      "And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.\n",
      "And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:\n",
      "Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.\n",
      "And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:\n",
      "Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;\n",
      "And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\n",
      "And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n",
      "And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,\n",
      "Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD, before my death.\n",
      "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command thee.\n",
      "Go now to the flock, and bring me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth:\n",
      "And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.\n",
      "And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:\n",
      "My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.\n",
      "And his mother said to him, upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.\n",
      "And he went, and took, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved.\n",
      "And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son:\n",
      "And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth part of his neck:\n",
      "And she gave the savory meat, and the bread which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n",
      "And he came to his father, and said, My father: And he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?\n",
      "And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n",
      "And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.\n",
      "And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou art my very son Esau, or not.\n",
      "And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob\\'s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\n",
      "And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau\\'s hands: So he blessed him.\n",
      "And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n",
      "And he said, bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son\\'s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he ate: and he brought him wine, and he drank.\n",
      "And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.\n",
      "And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:\n",
      "Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:\n",
      "Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother\\'s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n",
      "And he also had made savory meat, and brought it to his father; and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son\\'s venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n",
      "And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born Esau.\n",
      "And Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.\n",
      "And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.\n",
      "And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.\n",
      "And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me twice: he took away my birth-right; and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?\n",
      "And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to thee, my son?\n",
      "And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "And Isaac his father answered, and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;\n",
      "And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother: and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\n",
      "And Esau hated Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\n",
      "And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.\n",
      "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;\n",
      "And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother\\'s fury shall turn away;\n",
      "Till thy brother\\'s anger shall turn away from thee, and he shall forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and bring thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?\n",
      "And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these who are of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?\n",
      "And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.\n",
      "Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother\\'s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother\\'s brother.\n",
      "And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;\n",
      "And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land in which thou art a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.\n",
      "And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob\\'s and Esau\\'s mother.\n",
      "When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;\n",
      "And that Jacob obeyed his father, and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;\n",
      "And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;\n",
      "Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham\\'s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.\n",
      "And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went towards Haran.\n",
      "And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set: and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.\n",
      "And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.\n",
      "And behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.\n",
      "And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n",
      "And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land: for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have declared to thee.\n",
      "And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.\n",
      "And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is no other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\n",
      "And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.\n",
      "And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.\n",
      "And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,\n",
      "So that I come again to my father\\'s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:\n",
      "And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God\\'s house: and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth to thee.\n",
      "Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.\n",
      "And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well\\'s mouth.\n",
      "And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well\\'s mouth and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well\\'s mouth in its place.\n",
      "And Jacob said to them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, We are from Haran.\n",
      "And he said to them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? and they said, We know him.\n",
      "And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n",
      "And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be collected: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.\n",
      "And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks are collected, and till they roll the stone from the well\\'s mouth; then we water the sheep.\n",
      "And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father\\'s sheep: for she kept them.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother\\'s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother\\'s brother; that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well\\'s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother\\'s brother.\n",
      "And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father\\'s brother, and that he was Rebekah\\'s son; and she ran and told her father.\n",
      "And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister\\'s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\n",
      "And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh: and he abode with him the space of a month.\n",
      "And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what shall thy wages be?\n",
      "And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n",
      "Leah was tender-eyed, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.\n",
      "And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.\n",
      "And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.\n",
      "And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had to her.\n",
      "And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife (for my days are fulfilled) that I may go in to her.\n",
      "And Laban assembled all the men of the place, and made a feast.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.\n",
      "And Laban gave to his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid for a handmaid.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? why then hast thou deceived me?\n",
      "And Laban said, it must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.\n",
      "Fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n",
      "And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel, his daughter, for a wife also.\n",
      "And Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid.\n",
      "And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n",
      "And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he made her fruitful: but Rachel was barren.\n",
      "And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.\n",
      "And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.\n",
      "And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband adhere to me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.\n",
      "And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah, and left bearing.\n",
      "And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.\n",
      "And Jacob\\'s anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, Am I in God\\'s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\n",
      "And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.\n",
      "And she gave him Bilhah, her handmaid, for a wife: and Jacob went in to her.\n",
      "And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.\n",
      "And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore she called his name Dan.\n",
      "And Bilhah, Rachel\\'s maid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.\n",
      "And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\n",
      "When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah, her maid, and gave her Jacob for a wife.\n",
      "And Zilpah, Leah\\'s maid, bore Jacob a son.\n",
      "And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.\n",
      "And Zilpah, Leah\\'s maid, bore Jacob a second son.\n",
      "And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.\n",
      "And Reuben went, in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son\\'s mandrakes.\n",
      "And she said to her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son\\'s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son\\'s mandrakes.\n",
      "And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son\\'s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.\n",
      "And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.\n",
      "And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\n",
      "And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.\n",
      "And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dower; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.\n",
      "And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n",
      "And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and rendered her fruitful.\n",
      "And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:\n",
      "And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD will add to me another son.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.\n",
      "Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.\n",
      "And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience, that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.\n",
      "And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n",
      "And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me.\n",
      "For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?\n",
      "And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:\n",
      "I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.\n",
      "So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be accounted stolen with me.\n",
      "And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.\n",
      "And he removed that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted; every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hands of his sons.\n",
      "And he set three days\\' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban\\'s flocks.\n",
      "And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.\n",
      "And he set the rods, which he had peeled, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.\n",
      "And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted.\n",
      "And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban: and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban\\'s cattle.\n",
      "And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.\n",
      "But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban\\'s, and the stronger Jacob\\'s.\n",
      "And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.\n",
      "And he heard the words of Laban\\'s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father\\'s; and of that which was our father\\'s hath he obtained all this glory.\n",
      "And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not towards him as before.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\n",
      "And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field to his flock,\n",
      "And said to them, I see your father\\'s countenance, that it is not towards me as before: but the God of my father hath been with me.\n",
      "And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n",
      "And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times: but God suffered him not to hurt me.\n",
      "If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then all the cattle bore ring-streaked.\n",
      "Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.\n",
      "And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, Lift up now thy eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth to thee.\n",
      "I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst to me a vow: now arise, depart from this land, and return to the land of thy kindred.\n",
      "And Rachel and Leah answered, and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father\\'s house?\n",
      "Are we not counted by him strangers; for he hath sold us, and hath quite consumed also our money.\n",
      "For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children\\'s: now then whatever God hath said to thee, do.\n",
      "Then Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;\n",
      "And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gained, the cattle of his getting, which he had gained in Padan-aram; to go to Isaac, his father, in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father\\'s.\n",
      "And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he was about to depart.\n",
      "So he fled with all that he had; and he arose, and passed over the river, and set his face towards the mount Gilead.\n",
      "And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.\n",
      "And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days\\' journey: and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n",
      "And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n",
      "Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban, with his brethren, pitched in the mount of Gilead.\n",
      "And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?\n",
      "Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\n",
      "And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons, and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.\n",
      "It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n",
      "And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou didst earnestly long after thy father\\'s house; yet why hast thou stolen my gods?\n",
      "And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, It may be thou wouldest take thy daughters from me by force.\n",
      "With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee: for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.\n",
      "And Laban went into Jacob\\'s tent, and into Leah\\'s tent, and into the two maid-servants\\' tents; but he found them not. Then he went out of Leah\\'s tent, and entered into Rachel\\'s tent.\n",
      "Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel\\'s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.\n",
      "And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.\n",
      "And Jacob was wroth, and chid with Laban: and Jacob answered, and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so eagerly pursued after me?\n",
      "Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household-stuff? set it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.\n",
      "These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.\n",
      "That which was torn by beasts, I brought not to thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.\n",
      "Thus I was; in the day the drouth consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.\n",
      "Thus have I been twenty years in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n",
      "Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\n",
      "And Laban answered, and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have borne?\n",
      "Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.\n",
      "And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n",
      "And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they ate there upon the heap.\n",
      "And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed:\n",
      "And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:\n",
      "And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.\n",
      "If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives besides my daughters; no man is with us; See, God is witness betwixt me and thee.\n",
      "And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;\n",
      "This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.\n",
      "The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.\n",
      "Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mount.\n",
      "And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.\n",
      "And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n",
      "And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God\\'s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.\n",
      "And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.\n",
      "And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there till now:\n",
      "And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.\n",
      "And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.\n",
      "Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and herds, and camels, into two bands;\n",
      "And said, If Esau shall come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left, will escape.\n",
      "And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who saidst to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee;\n",
      "I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown to thy servant: for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.\n",
      "Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he shall come and smite me, and the mother with the children.\n",
      "And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n",
      "And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau, his brother;\n",
      "Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,\n",
      "Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.\n",
      "And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.\n",
      "And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau, my brother, meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?\n",
      "Then thou shalt say, They are thy servant Jacob\\'s: it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and behold also he is behind us.\n",
      "And so he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, In this manner shall ye speak to Esau, when ye find him.\n",
      "And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.\n",
      "So the present went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the company.\n",
      "And he arose that night, and took his two wives, and his two women-servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.\n",
      "And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had.\n",
      "And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him, until the breaking of the day.\n",
      "And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh: and the hollow of Jacob\\'s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.\n",
      "And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh; And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n",
      "And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n",
      "And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God, and with men, and hast prevailed.\n",
      "And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name: And he said, why is it that thou dost ask after my name? and he blessed him there.\n",
      "And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\n",
      "And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.\n",
      "Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrunk, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob\\'s thigh in the sinew that shrunk.\n",
      "And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.\n",
      "And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n",
      "And he passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, till he came near to his brother.\n",
      "And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.\n",
      "And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given to thy servant.\n",
      "Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.\n",
      "And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n",
      "And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, these are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast to thyself.\n",
      "And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast been pleased with me.\n",
      "Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough: and he urged him, and he took it.\n",
      "And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.\n",
      "And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me, and if men should over-drive them one day, all the flock will die.\n",
      "Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according as the cattle that go before me, and the children are able to endure; until I come to my lord to Seir.\n",
      "And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the people that are with me: And he said, What needeth it? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.\n",
      "And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.\n",
      "And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.\n",
      "And he bought a part of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem\\'s father, for a hundred pieces of money.\n",
      "And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.\n",
      "And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.\n",
      "And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.\n",
      "And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.\n",
      "And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife.\n",
      "And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the field:) and Jacob held his peace till they had come.\n",
      "And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.\n",
      "And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob\\'s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.\n",
      "And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her to him for a wife.\n",
      "And make ye marriages with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.\n",
      "And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.\n",
      "And Shechem said to her father, and to her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me, I will give.\n",
      "Ask me never so much dower and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me: but give me the damsel for a wife.\n",
      "And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, (because he had defiled Dinah their sister,)\n",
      "And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised: for that would be a reproach to us:\n",
      "But in this will we consent to you: If ye will be as we are, that every male of you shall be circumcised;\n",
      "Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.\n",
      "But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.\n",
      "And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor\\'s son.\n",
      "And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob\\'s daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.\n",
      "And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,\n",
      "These men are peaceable with us, therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein: for the land, behold, it is large enough for them: let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.\n",
      "Only herein, will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us shall be circumcised, as they are circumcised.\n",
      "Will not their cattle, and their substance, and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.\n",
      "And to Hamor and to Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city: and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah\\'s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.\n",
      "And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem\\'s house, and went out.\n",
      "The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city; because they had defiled their sister.\n",
      "They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field.\n",
      "And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.\n",
      "And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites, and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they will assemble themselves against me, and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.\n",
      "And they said, Should he deal with our sister, as with a harlot?\n",
      "And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.\n",
      "Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:\n",
      "And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.\n",
      "And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the ear-rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.\n",
      "And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.\n",
      "So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (that is Beth-el) he and all the people that were with him.\n",
      "And he erected there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.\n",
      "But Deborah, Rebekah\\'s nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el, under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.\n",
      "And God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram; and blessed him.\n",
      "And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his name Israel.\n",
      "And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a multitude of nations shall spring from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.\n",
      "And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.\n",
      "And God went up from him, in the place where he talked with him.\n",
      "And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink-offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.\n",
      "And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el.\n",
      "And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.\n",
      "And it came to pass when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.\n",
      "And it came to pass as her soul was in departing (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.\n",
      "And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem.\n",
      "And Jacob set a pillar on her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel\\'s grave to this day.\n",
      "And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father\\'s concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:\n",
      "The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob\\'s first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:\n",
      "The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:\n",
      "And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel\\'s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:\n",
      "And the sons of Zilpah, Leah\\'s handmaid; Gad, and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Padan-aram.\n",
      "And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah (which is Hebron) where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n",
      "And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.\n",
      "And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.\n",
      "Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;\n",
      "And Bashemath, Ishmael\\'s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.\n",
      "And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel;\n",
      "And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had acquired in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.\n",
      "For their riches were more than that they might dwell together: and the land wherein they were strangers could not sustain them, because of their cattle.\n",
      "Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\n",
      "And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites, in mount Seir:\n",
      "These are the names of Esau\\'s sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.\n",
      "And the sons of Eliphaz were, Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.\n",
      "And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau\\'s son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau\\'s wife.\n",
      "And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau\\'s wife.\n",
      "And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon Esau\\'s wife: and she bore to Esau, Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.\n",
      "These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,\n",
      "Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes, descendants of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom: these were the sons of Adah.\n",
      "And these are the sons of Reuel Esau\\'s son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes, descendants of Reuel, in the land of Edom: these are the sons of Bashemath Esau\\'s wife.\n",
      "And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau\\'s wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes, descendants of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah Esau\\'s wife.\n",
      "These are the sons of Esau (who is Edom) and these are their dukes.\n",
      "These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah.\n",
      "And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.\n",
      "And the children of Lotan were Hori, and Heman: and Lotan\\'s sister was Timna.\n",
      "And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.\n",
      "And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah and Anah; this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.\n",
      "And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.\n",
      "And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.\n",
      "The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Achan.\n",
      "The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.\n",
      "These are the dukes, descendants of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,\n",
      "Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan; these are the dukes, descendants of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.\n",
      "And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.\n",
      "And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad (who smote Midian in the field of Moab) reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.\n",
      "And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife\\'s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.\n",
      "And these are the names of the dukes, descendants of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,\n",
      "Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,\n",
      "Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar.\n",
      "Duke Magdiel, duke Iram; these are the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations, in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.\n",
      "And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father\\'s wives: and Joseph brought to his father their evil report.\n",
      "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.\n",
      "And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.\n",
      "And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.\n",
      "And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:\n",
      "For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood around and made obeisance to my sheaf.\n",
      "And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.\n",
      "And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more: and behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\n",
      "And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said to him, what is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?\n",
      "And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.\n",
      "And his brethren went to feed their father\\'s flock in Shechem.\n",
      "And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\n",
      "And a certain man found him, and behold he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?\n",
      "And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.\n",
      "And the man said, They have departed hence: for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan.\n",
      "And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him.\n",
      "And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer is coming.\n",
      "Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit; and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.\n",
      "And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him from their hands: and said, Let us not kill him.\n",
      "And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might deliver him from their hands, to bring him back to his father.\n",
      "And it came to pass when Joseph had come to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him.\n",
      "And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty; there was no water in it.\n",
      "And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry them down to Egypt.\n",
      "And Judah said to his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood.\n",
      "Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh: and his brethren were content.\n",
      "Then there passed by Midianites, merchants; and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\n",
      "And Reuben returned to the pit; and behold, Joseph was not in the pit: and he rent his clothes.\n",
      "And he returned to his brethren, and said, The child is not: and I, whither shall I go?\n",
      "And they took Joseph\\'s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood:\n",
      "And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son\\'s coat or not.\n",
      "And he knew it, and said, It is my son\\'s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.\n",
      "And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.\n",
      "And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning: Thus his father wept for him.\n",
      "And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh\\'s, and captain of the guard.\n",
      "And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n",
      "And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in to her.\n",
      "And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er.\n",
      "And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan.\n",
      "And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.\n",
      "And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, whose name was Tamar.\n",
      "And Er, Judah\\'s first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.\n",
      "And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother\\'s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\n",
      "And Onan knew that the seed would not be his: and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother\\'s wife, that he frustrated the purpose, lest he should give seed to his brother.\n",
      "And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.\n",
      "Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father\\'s house, till Shelah my son shall be grown; (for he said, Lest perhaps he die also as his brethren did:) and Tamar went and dwelt in her father\\'s house.\n",
      "And in process of time, the daughter of Shuah Judah\\'s wife died: and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.\n",
      "And it was told to Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath, to shear his sheep.\n",
      "And she put off from her, her widow\\'s garments, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath: for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him for a wife.\n",
      "When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face.\n",
      "And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me have access to thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law:) and she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayst have access to me?\n",
      "And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock: and she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou sendest it?\n",
      "And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? and she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thy hand: and he gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.\n",
      "And she arose and went her way and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.\n",
      "And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman\\'s hand: but he found her not.\n",
      "Then he asked the men of that place, saying, where is the harlot that was openly by the way-side? and they said, There was no harlot in this place.\n",
      "And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.\n",
      "And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\n",
      "And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold she is with child by lewdness: and Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.\n",
      "When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.\n",
      "And Judah acknowledged them, and said She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son: and he knew her again no more.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb.\n",
      "And it came to pass when she travailed, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.\n",
      "And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.\n",
      "And afterwards came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zarah.\n",
      "And Joseph was brought down to Egypt: and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.\n",
      "And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man: and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\n",
      "And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n",
      "And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.\n",
      "And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian\\'s house for Joseph\\'s sake: and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house, and in the field.\n",
      "And he left all that he had in Joseph\\'s hand; and he knew not aught he had, save the bread which he ate; and Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that his master\\'s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph: and she said, Lie with me.\n",
      "But he refused, and said to his master\\'s wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand:\n",
      "There is none greater in his house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\n",
      "And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\n",
      "And it came to pass, about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.\n",
      "And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went out.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled forth,\n",
      "That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us: he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and went out.\n",
      "And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.\n",
      "And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought to us, came in to me to mock me.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.\n",
      "And Joseph\\'s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king\\'s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.\n",
      "But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n",
      "And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph\\'s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatever they did there, was done by him.\n",
      "The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him: and that which he did the LORD made it to prosper.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh was wroth with two of his officers, with the chief of the butlers, and with the chief of the bakers.\n",
      "And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n",
      "And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season in custody.\n",
      "And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream; the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.\n",
      "And Joseph came to them in the morning, and looked upon them, and behold, they were sad.\n",
      "And he asked Pharaoh\\'s officers that were with him in the ward of his lord\\'s house, saying, Why look ye so sad to-day?\n",
      "And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\n",
      "And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;\n",
      "And on the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes:\n",
      "And Pharaoh\\'s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh\\'s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh\\'s hand.\n",
      "And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days;\n",
      "Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh\\'s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.\n",
      "But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness to me, I pray thee, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:\n",
      "For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.\n",
      "When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, I had three white baskets on my head:\n",
      "And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bake-meats for Pharaoh; and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.\n",
      "And Joseph answered, and said, This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days:\n",
      "Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\n",
      "And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh\\'s birth-day, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.\n",
      "And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh\\'s hand:\n",
      "But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n",
      "Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river.\n",
      "And behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored cows and fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\n",
      "And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river.\n",
      "And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.\n",
      "And he slept and dreamed the second time: and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\n",
      "And behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.\n",
      "And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.\n",
      "Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:\n",
      "Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard\\'s house, both me, and the chief baker:\n",
      "And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he: we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n",
      "And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he interpreted.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was: me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came before Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard it said of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.\n",
      "And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:\n",
      "And behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed, and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow:\n",
      "And behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor, and very ill-favored, and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:\n",
      "And the lean and the ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows:\n",
      "And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\n",
      "And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:\n",
      "And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:\n",
      "And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this to the magicians; but there was none that could explain it to me.\n",
      "And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\n",
      "The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.\n",
      "And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind will be seven years of famine.\n",
      "This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is about to do he showeth to Pharaoh.\n",
      "Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:\n",
      "And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;\n",
      "And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following: for it will be very grievous.\n",
      "And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.\n",
      "Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.\n",
      "And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh; and let them keep food in the cities.\n",
      "And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land may not perish through the famine.\n",
      "And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a man as this is, a man in whom the spirit of God is?\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:\n",
      "Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph\\'s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;\n",
      "And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had: and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh called Joseph\\'s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On: and Joseph went over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt: and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfulls.\n",
      "And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field which was around every city, he laid up in the same.\n",
      "And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.\n",
      "And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came: which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.\n",
      "And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father\\'s house.\n",
      "And the name of the second called he Ephraim: for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\n",
      "And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.\n",
      "And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.\n",
      "And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he saith to you, do.\n",
      "And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn; because the famine was distressing in all lands.\n",
      "Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?\n",
      "And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: go down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\n",
      "And Joseph\\'s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.\n",
      "But Benjamin, Joseph\\'s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren: for he said, Lest perhaps mischief shall befall him.\n",
      "And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph\\'s brethren came, and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the earth.\n",
      "And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\n",
      "And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n",
      "And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.\n",
      "And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have thy servants come.\n",
      "We are all one man\\'s sons; we are true men; thy servants are no spies.\n",
      "And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.\n",
      "And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.\n",
      "And Joseph said to them, That is what I spoke to you, saying, Ye are spies:\n",
      "By this ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother shall come hither.\n",
      "Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there is any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.\n",
      "And he put them all together into custody three days.\n",
      "And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:\n",
      "If ye are true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:\n",
      "But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\n",
      "And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\n",
      "And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the young man; and ye would not hear? therefore behold also his blood is required.\n",
      "And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.\n",
      "And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.\n",
      "Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man\\'s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them.\n",
      "And they loaded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\n",
      "And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money: for behold, it was in his sack\\'s mouth.\n",
      "And he said to his brethren, My money is restored; and see it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done to us?\n",
      "And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them, saying,\n",
      "The man who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.\n",
      "And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:\n",
      "We are twelve brethren, sons of our father: one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and depart:\n",
      "And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: then will I deliver to you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\n",
      "And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man\\'s bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.\n",
      "And Jacob their father said to them, Me have ye bereaved: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.\n",
      "And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.\n",
      "And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief shall befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "\\\\43:1\\\\And the famine was severe in the land.\n",
      "\\\\43:2\\\\And it came to pass, when they had consumed the corn which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.\n",
      "\\\\43:3\\\\And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n",
      "\\\\43:4\\\\If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:\n",
      "\\\\43:5\\\\But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n",

      "\\\\43:7\\\\And they said, The man asked us strictly concerning our state, and our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?\n",
      "\\\\43:8\\\\And Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.\n",

      "\\\\43:11\\\\And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:\n",

      "\\\\43:25\\\\And they made ready the present against Joseph should come at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n",
      "\\\\43:26\\\\And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.\n",
      "\\\\43:27\\\\And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?\n",
      "\\\\43:28\\\\And they answered, Thy servant, our father, is in good health, he is yet alive: and they bowed their heads and made obeisance.\n",
      "\\\\43:29\\\\And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother\\'s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.\n",
      "\\\\43:30\\\\And Joseph made haste; for his bowels yearned towards his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.\n",
      "\\\\43:31\\\\And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.\n",
      "\\\\43:32\\\\And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.\n",
      "\\\\43:33\\\\And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birth-right, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men wondered one at another.\n",
      "\\\\43:34\\\\And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin\\'s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.\n",
      "And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men\\'s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man\\'s money in his sack\\'s mouth.\n",
      "And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack\\'s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money: and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.\n",
      "As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they, and their asses.\n",
      "And when they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?\n",
      "Is not this the cup in which my lord drinketh, and by which indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\n",
      "And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.\n",
      "And they said to him, Why saith my lord these words? Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing:\n",
      "Behold, the money which we found in our sacks\\' mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan: how then should we steal from thy lord\\'s house silver or gold?\n",
      "With whom soever of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord\\'s bond-men.\n",
      "And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it shall be found, shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.\n",
      "Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.\n",
      "And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin\\'s sack.\n",
      "Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city.\n",
      "And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph\\'s house, (for he was yet there:) and they fell before him on the ground.\n",
      "And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?\n",
      "And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are my lord\\'s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.\n",
      "And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father.\n",
      "Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord\\'s ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.\n",
      "My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?\n",
      "And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\n",
      "And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.\n",
      "And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.\n",
      "And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when we came to thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord.\n",
      "And our father said, Go again; buy us a little food.\n",
      "And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man\\'s face, except our youngest brother shall be with us.\n",
      "And thy servant my father, said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons:\n",
      "And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:\n",
      "And if ye take this also from me, and mischief shall befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; (seeing that his life is bound up in the lad\\'s life)\n",
      "It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I will bear the blame to my father for ever.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bond-man to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren.\n",
      "For how shall I return to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father.\n",
      "Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me: and there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brethren.\n",
      "And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you: and they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.\n",
      "Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God sent me before you to preserve life.\n",
      "For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in which there shall neither be tillage nor harvest.\n",
      "And God sent me before you, to preserve for you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\n",
      "So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Haste ye, and return to my father, and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me; delay not:\n",
      "And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy children, and thy children\\'s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:\n",
      "And there will I nourish thee, (for yet there are five years of famine,) lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, should come to poverty.\n",
      "And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh to you.\n",
      "And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste, and bring down my father hither.\n",
      "And he fell upon his brother Benjamin\\'s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.\n",
      "Moreover, he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.\n",
      "And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh\\'s house, saying, Joseph\\'s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, return to the land of Canaan;\n",
      "And take your father, and your households, and come to me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.\n",
      "Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.\n",
      "Also regard not your furniture; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.\n",
      "To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.\n",
      "And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and meat, for his father by the way.\n",
      "So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that ye contend not by the way.\n",
      "And they went up from Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father,\n",
      "And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob\\'s heart fainted, for he believed them not.\n",
      "And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:\n",
      "And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.\n",
      "And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.\n",
      "And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob: and he said, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:\n",
      "I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\n",
      "And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.\n",
      "And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:\n",
      "His sons, and his sons\\' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons\\' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.\n",
      "And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob\\'s first-born.\n",
      "And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.\n",
      "And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\n",
      "And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n",
      "And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron, and Hamul.\n",
      "And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.\n",
      "And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.\n",
      "These are the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.\n",
      "And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggai, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.\n",
      "And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.\n",
      "These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter: and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls.\n",
      "The sons of Rachel Jacob\\'s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.\n",
      "And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.\n",
      "And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.\n",
      "These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the souls were fourteen.\n",
      "And the sons of Dan; Hushim.\n",
      "And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.\n",
      "These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob: all the souls were seven.\n",
      "All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob\\'s sons\\' wives, all the souls were sixty and six.\n",
      "And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.\n",
      "And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.\n",
      "And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went to meet Israel his father to Goshen; and presented himself to him: and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.\n",
      "And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his brethren, and to his father\\'s house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren, and my father\\'s house, who were in the land of Canaan are come to me.\n",
      "And the men are shepherds, for their employment hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?\n",
      "That ye shall say, The occupation of thy servants hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.\n",
      "Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.\n",
      "And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.\n",
      "They said moreover to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land: for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.\n",
      "And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren have come to thee:\n",
      "The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.\n",
      "And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old art thou?\n",
      "And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, nor have they attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\n",
      "And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.\n",
      "And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father\\'s household, with bread according to their families.\n",
      "And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very distressing, so that the land of Egypt, and all the land of Canaan, fainted by reason of the famine.\n",
      "And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh\\'s house.\n",
      "And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence: for the money faileth.\n",
      "And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money hath failed.\n",
      "And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread, for all their cattle, for that year.\n",
      "When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not aught left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands:\n",
      "Why shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.\n",
      "And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh\\'s.\n",
      "And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n",
      "Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them by Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.\n",
      "Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.\n",
      "And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh\\'s servants.\n",
      "And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh\\'s.\n",
      "And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions in it and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.\n",
      "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred and forty seven years.\n",
      "And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:\n",
      "But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.\n",
      "And he said, Swear to me: and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed\\'s head.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.\n",
      "And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh to thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.\n",
      "And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,\n",
      "And said to me, Behold I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee, for an everlasting possession.\n",
      "And now, thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\n",
      "And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.\n",
      "And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same is Beth-lehem.\n",
      "And Israel beheld Joseph\\'s sons, and said, Who are these?\n",
      "And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, and I will bless them.\n",
      "(Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see:) And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.\n",
      "And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.\n",
      "And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.\n",
      "And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel\\'s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israel\\'s right hand, and brought them near to him.\n",
      "And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim\\'s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh\\'s head, guiding his hands by design; for Manasseh was the first-born.\n",
      "And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long to this day,\n",
      "The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac: and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.\n",
      "And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he lifted his father\\'s hand, to remove it from Ephraim\\'s head to Manasseh\\'s head.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.\n",
      "And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.\n",
      "And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.\n",
      "And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.\n",
      "Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.\n",
      "And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Assemble yourselves, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.\n",
      "Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob: and hearken to Israel your father.\n",
      "Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellence of dignity, and the excellence of power:\n",

      "Simeon and Levi are brethren: instruments of cruelty are in, their habitations.\n",
      "O my soul, come not thou into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.\n",
      "Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce: and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.\n",
      "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand shall be on the neck of thy enemies: thy father\\'s children shall bow down before thee.\n",

      "In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.\n",
      "(There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah,)\n",
      "The purchase of the field and of the cave that is in it, was from the children of Heth.\n",
      "And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "And Joseph fell upon his father\\'s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.\n",
      "And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.\n",
      "And forty days were fulfilled for him; (for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed:) and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.\n",
      "And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,\n",
      "My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.\n",
      "And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,\n",
      "And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father\\'s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.\n",
      "And there went with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.\n",
      "And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.\n",
      "And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.\n",
      "And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:\n",
      "For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.\n",
      "And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\n",
      "And when Joseph\\'s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.\n",
      "And they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,\n",
      "So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did to thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.\n",
      "And his brethren also went and fell down before his face: and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.\n",
      "And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?\n",
      "But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive.\n",
      "Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.\n",
      "And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father\\'s house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.\n",
      "And Joseph saw Ephraim\\'s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph\\'s knees.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n",
      "And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.\n",
      "So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n",
      "Now these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.\n",
      "Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,\n",
      "Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,\n",
      "Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.\n",
      "And all the souls that descended from Jacob, were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.\n",
      "And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.\n",
      "And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.\n",
      "Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.\n",
      "And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.\n",
      "Come, let us deal wisely with them: lest they multiply, and it shall come to pass, that when there falleth out any war, they will join with our enemies, and fight against us, and depart from the land.\n",
      "Therefore they set over them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom, and Raamses.\n",
      "But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor.\n",
      "And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service in which they made them serve, was with rigor.\n",
      "And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives (of which the name of one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:)\n",
      "And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it shall be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it shall be a daughter, then she shall live.\n",
      "But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male-children alive.\n",
      "And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male-children alive?\n",
      "And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in to them.\n",
      "Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.\n",
      "And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.\n",
      "And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.\n",
      "And there went a man of the house of Levi, and married a daughter of Levi.\n",
      "And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.\n",
      "And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river\\'s brink.\n",
      "And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.\n",
      "And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river, and her maidens walked along by the river\\'s side: and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.\n",
      "And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews\\' children.\n",
      "Then said his sister to Pharaoh\\'s daughter, Shall I go, and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?\n",
      "And Pharaoh\\'s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child\\'s mother.\n",
      "And Pharaoh\\'s daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.\n",
      "And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh\\'s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.\n",
      "And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.\n",
      "And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.\n",
      "And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smitest thou thy fellow?\n",
      "And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.\n",
      "Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.\n",
      "Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father\\'s flock.\n",
      "And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.\n",
      "And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon to day?\n",
      "And they said, An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.\n",
      "And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.\n",
      "And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.\n",
      "And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.\n",
      "And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry ascended to God, by reason of the bondage.\n",
      "And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\n",
      "And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect to them.\n",
      "Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.\n",
      "And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.\n",
      "And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, Approach not hither: put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place on which thou standest is holy ground.\n",
      "Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face: for he was afraid to look upon God.\n",
      "And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their task-masters; for I know their sorrows;\n",
      "And I am come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land, to a good land, and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.\n",
      "Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.\n",
      "Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\n",
      "And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token to thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.\n",
      "And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say to them?\n",
      "And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: And he said, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me to you.\n",
      "And God said, moreover, to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.\n",
      "Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.\n",
      "And I have said, I will bring you out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.\n",
      "And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go (we beseech thee) three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.\n",
      "And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.\n",
      "And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.\n",
      "And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that when ye go, ye shall not go empty:\n",
      "But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that dwelleth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters: and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.\n",
      "And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared to thee.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.\n",
      "And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent: and Moses fled from before it.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:\n",
      "That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.\n",
      "And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.\n",
      "And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken to thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoke to thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Who hath made man\\'s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD.\n",
      "Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.\n",
      "And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.\n",
      "And thou shalt speak to him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.\n",
      "And he shall speak for thee to the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.\n",
      "And thou shalt take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shalt perform signs.\n",
      "And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.\n",
      "And Moses took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou perform all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.\n",
      "And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my first-born.\n",
      "And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou shalt refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy first-born.\n",
      "And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.\n",
      "Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.\n",
      "So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.\n",
      "And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron went, and assembled all the elders of the children of Israel:\n",
      "And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs in the sight of the people.\n",
      "And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads, and worshiped.\n",
      "And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.\n",
      "And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days\\' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.\n",
      "And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their works; go you to your burdens.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.\n",
      "And Pharaoh commanded the same day the task-masters of the people, and their officers, saying,\n",
      "Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves.\n",
      "And the number of the bricks which they made heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle: therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.\n",
      "Let more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein: and let them not regard vain words.\n",
      "And the task-masters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.\n",
      "Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not aught of your work shall be diminished.\n",
      "So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble instead of straw.\n",
      "And the task-masters hastened them, saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.\n",
      "And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh\\'s task-masters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?\n",
      "Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servants?\n",
      "There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thy own people.\n",
      "But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go, and do sacrifice to the LORD.\n",
      "Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.\n",
      "And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks of your daily task.\n",
      "And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:\n",
      "And they said to them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to slay us.\n",
      "And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why hast thou so ill treated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?\n",
      "For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.\n",
      "Then the LORD said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them from his land.\n",
      "And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the LORD:\n",
      "And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.\n",
      "And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers.\n",
      "And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage: and I have remembered my covenant.\n",
      "Wherefore say to the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with out-stretched arm, and with great judgments:\n",
      "And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.\n",
      "And I will bring you into the land, concerning which I swore to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel: but they hearkened not to Moses, by reason of anguish of spirit, and cruel bondage.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Go in, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel depart from his land.\n",
      "And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "These are the heads of their father\\'s houses: The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these are the families of Reuben.\n",
      "And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.\n",
      "And these are the names of the sons of Levi, according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred and thirty-seven years.\n",
      "The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.\n",
      "And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred and thirty-three years.\n",
      "And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi, according to their generations.\n",
      "And Amram took him Jochebed, his father\\'s sister, for a wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty-seven years.\n",
      "And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.\n",
      "And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.\n",
      "And Aaron took him Elisheba daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, for a wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.\n",
      "And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.\n",
      "And Eleazar, Aaron\\'s son, took him one of the daughters of Putiel for a wife; and she bore to him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites, according to their families.\n",
      "These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.\n",
      "These are they who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.\n",
      "And it came to pass, on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,\n",
      "That the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I say to thee.\n",
      "And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken to me?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.\n",
      "Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.\n",
      "And I will harden Pharaoh\\'s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "But Pharaoh shall not hearken to you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great judgments.\n",
      "And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.\n",
      "And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, saying,\n",
      "When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then thou shalt say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh also called the wise-men, and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.\n",
      "For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron\\'s rod swallowed up their rods.\n",
      "And he hardened Pharaoh\\'s heart that he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh\\'s heart is hardened; he refuseth to let the people go.\n",
      "Go to Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out to the water, and thou shalt stand by the river\\'s brink against he cometh; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.\n",
      "And thou shalt say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.\n",
      "Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.\n",
      "And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall be offensive in smell; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood: and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood.\n",
      "And the fish that was in the river died; and the river was offensive in smell, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh\\'s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken to them; as the LORD had said.\n",
      "And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he regard this also.\n",
      "And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.\n",
      "And seven days were fulfilled after that the LORD had smitten the river.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go that they may serve me.\n",
      "And if thou shalt refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:\n",
      "And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy ovens, and into thy kneading troughs:\n",
      "And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people: and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee, and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?\n",
      "And he said, To-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like the LORD our God.\n",
      "And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the LORD, because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.\n",
      "And the LORD did according to the word of Moses: and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.\n",
      "And they gathered them into heaps: and the land was offensive in smell.\n",
      "But when Pharaoh saw that there was respit, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them, as the LORD had said.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the magicians did so with their inchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man and upon beast.\n",
      "Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh\\'s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; (lo, he cometh forth to the water) and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n",
      "Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they are.\n",
      "And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.\n",
      "And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to-morrow shall this sign be.\n",
      "And the LORD did so: and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants\\' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.\n",
      "And Pharaoh called for Moses, and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.\n",
      "And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?\n",
      "We will go three days\\' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he shall command us.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.\n",
      "And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD:\n",
      "And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.\n",
      "And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.\n",
      "Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n",
      "For if thou shalt refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,\n",
      "Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.\n",
      "And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel, and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.\n",
      "And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.\n",
      "And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it towards heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.\n",
      "And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it towards heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.\n",
      "And the magicians could not stand before Moses, because of the boil: for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.\n",
      "And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had spoke to Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n",
      "For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people: that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.\n",
      "For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.\n",
      "And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, to show in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.\n",
      "As yet dost thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?\n",
      "Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since its foundation even until now.\n",
      "Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.\n",
      "He that feared the word of the LORD, among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:\n",
      "And he that regarded not the word of the LORD, left his servants and his cattle in the field.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground: and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.\n",
      "So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt, since it became a nation.\n",
      "And the hail smote, throughout all the land of Egypt, all that was in the field, both man and beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field.\n",
      "Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.\n",
      "And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.\n",
      "Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.\n",
      "And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD\\'S.\n",
      "But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.\n",
      "And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.\n",
      "But the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they were not grown up.\n",
      "And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.\n",
      "And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.\n",
      "And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants; that I might show these my signs before him:\n",
      "And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son\\'s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n",
      "Else, if thou shalt refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring the locusts into thy border:\n",
      "And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which hath escaped, which remaineth to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:\n",
      "And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers\\' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Pharaoh\\'s servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?\n",
      "And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the LORD.\n",
      "And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.\n",
      "Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you desired. And they were driven out from Pharaoh\\'s presence.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.\n",
      "And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night: and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.\n",
      "And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such.\n",
      "For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing on the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.\n",
      "Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God that he may take away from me this death only.\n",
      "And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea: there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.\n",
      "But the LORD hardened Pharaoh\\'s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand towards heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.\n",
      "And Moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven: and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:\n",
      "They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\n",
      "And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.\n",
      "And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices, and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.\n",
      "Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.\n",
      "But the LORD hardened Pharaoh\\'s heart, and he would not let them go.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to him, Depart from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more: for in that day thou seest my face, thou shalt die.\n",
      "And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.\n",
      "Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.\n",
      "And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh\\'s servants, and in the sight of the people.\n",
      "And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:\n",
      "And all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even to the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of beasts.\n",
      "And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more.\n",
      "But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.\n",
      "And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Depart thou, and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will depart: and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken to you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the LORD hardened Pharaoh\\'s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel depart from his land.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,\n",
      "This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.\n",
      "Speak ye to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house:\n",
      "And if the household shall be too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.\n",
      "Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it from the sheep or from the goats:\n",
      "And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.\n",
      "And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side-posts, and on the upper door-post of the houses, in which they shall eat it.\n",
      "And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire; and unleavened bread, and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.\n",
      "Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs, and with its entrails.\n",
      "And ye shall let nothing of it remain till the morning: and that which remaineth of it till the morning ye shall burn with fire.\n",
      "And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand: and ye shall eat it in haste; it is the LORD\\'S passover.\n",
      "For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast: and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.\n",
      "And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations: ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.\n",
      "Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eateth leavened bread, from the first day till the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.\n",
      "And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you: no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.\n",
      "And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.\n",
      "In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, till the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.\n",
      "Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he shall be a stranger, or born in the land.\n",
      "Ye shall eat nothing leavened: in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.\n",
      "Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take you a lamb, according to your families, and kill the passover.\n",
      "And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin: and none of you shall go out at the door of his house till the morning.\n",
      "For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.\n",
      "And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when ye shall have come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service?\n",
      "That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD\\'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped.\n",
      "And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, to the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.\n",
      "And Pharaoh rose in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for there was not a house where there was not one dead.\n",
      "And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise, and depart from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel: and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.\n",
      "Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone: and bless me also.\n",
      "And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men.\n",
      "And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses: and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.\n",
      "And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent to them such things as they requested: and they spoiled the Egyptians.\n",
      "And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.\n",
      "And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very many cattle.\n",
      "And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought from Egypt, for it was not leavened: because they were driven from Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.\n",
      "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.\n",
      "And it came to pass, at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD departed from the land of Egypt.\n",
      "It is a night to be much observed to the LORD, for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no stranger eat of it.\n",
      "But every man\\'s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.\n",
      "A foreigner, and a hired servant shall not eat of it.\n",
      "In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry aught of the flesh abroad out of the house: neither shall ye break a bone of it.\n",
      "All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.\n",
      "And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.\n",
      "One law shall be to him that is home-born, and to the stranger that sojourneth among you.\n",
      "Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\n",
      "And it came to pass the same day, that the LORD brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Sanctify to me all the first-born, whatever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\n",
      "And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.\n",
      "This day ye came out in the month Abib.\n",
      "And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; that thou shalt keep this service in this month.\n",
      "Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.\n",
      "Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days: and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.\n",
      "And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did to me when I came forth out of Egypt.\n",
      "And it shall be for a sign to thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes; that the LORD\\'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.\n",
      "Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.\n",
      "And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee,\n",
      "That thou shall set apart to the LORD all that openeth the matrix; and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast, the males shall be the LORD\\'S.\n",
      "And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the first-born of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.\n",
      "And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say to him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beasts: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the first-born of my children I redeem.\n",
      "And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thy eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near, for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.\n",
      "But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up harnassed from the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence with you.\n",
      "And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.\n",
      "And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light: to go by day and night.\n",
      "He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.\n",
      "For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.\n",
      "And I will harden Pharaoh\\'s heart, that he shall follow them; and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.\n",
      "And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?\n",
      "And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:\n",
      "And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.\n",
      "And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with a high hand.\n",
      "But the Egyptians pursued them (all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army) and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.\n",
      "And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were greatly afraid; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.\n",
      "And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to conduct us out of Egypt?\n",
      "Is not this the word that we told thee in Egypt, Saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.\n",
      "And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.\n",
      "The LORD will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Why criest thou to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward:\n",
      "But lift thou thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.\n",
      "And I, behold I, will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots and upon his horsemen.\n",
      "And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.\n",
      "And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed, and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:\n",
      "And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.\n",
      "And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\n",
      "And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.\n",
      "And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh\\'s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that, in the morning-watch, the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,\n",
      "And took off their chariot-wheels, and made them to move heavily, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.\n",
      "And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.\n",
      "And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.\n",
      "But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.\n",
      "Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians: and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.\n",
      "And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.\n",
      "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.\n",
      "The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him a habitation; my father\\'s God, and I will exalt him.\n",
      "The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.\n",
      "Pharaoh\\'s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.\n",
      "The depths have covered them: they sunk to the bottom as a stone.\n",
      "Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\n",
      "And in the greatness of thy excellence thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.\n",
      "And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were collected, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.\n",
      "The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.\n",
      "Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sunk as lead in the mighty waters.\n",
      "Who is like to thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders!\n",
      "Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.\n",
      "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation.\n",
      "The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.\n",
      "Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.\n",
      "Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thy arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.\n",
      "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in; in the sanctuary, O Lord. which thy hands have established.\n",
      "The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.\n",
      "For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.\n",
      "And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her, with timbrels, and with dances.\n",
      "And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.\n",
      "So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.\n",
      "And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah; for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.\n",
      "And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?\n",
      "And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which he cast into the waters, and the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,\n",
      "And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes; I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD that healeth thee.\n",
      "And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and seventy palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters.\n",
      "And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said to them, O that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, and when we did eat bread to the full: for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.\n",
      "Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:\n",
      "And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: And what are we, that ye murmur against us?\n",
      "And Moses said, This shall be when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: And what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel; Speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay around the host.\n",
      "And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground:\n",
      "And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.\n",
      "This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating: an omer for every man according to the number of your persons, take ye every man for them who are in his tents.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.\n",
      "And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack: they gathered every man according to his eating.\n",
      "And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.\n",
      "Notwithstanding, they hearkened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became offensive; and Moses was wroth with them.\n",
      "And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun became hot, it melted.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.\n",
      "And he said to them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To-morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to-day, and boil that ye will boil; and that which remaineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\n",
      "And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses ordered: and it did not putrefy, neither was there any worm therein.\n",
      "And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath to the LORD; to-day ye will not find it in the field.\n",
      "Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there will be none.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?\n",
      "See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days: abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.\n",
      "So the people rested on the seventh day.\n",
      "And the house of Israel called its name Manna: and it was like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.\n",
      "And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.\n",
      "As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.\n",
      "And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited: they ate manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.\n",
      "Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.\n",
      "And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.\n",
      "Wherefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? why do ye tempt the LORD?\n",
      "And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that thou hast brought us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?\n",
      "And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they are almost ready to stone me.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel: and thy rod, with which thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.\n",
      "Behold, I will stand before thee there on the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.\n",
      "And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?\n",
      "Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.\n",
      "And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.\n",
      "So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, went up to the top of the hill.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\n",
      "But Moses\\'s hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat upon it: and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.\n",
      "And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.\n",
      "And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-nissi:\n",
      "For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.\n",
      "When Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses\\'s father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt:\n",
      "Then Jethro, Moses\\'s father-in-law, took Zipporah Moses\\'s wife, after he had sent her back,\n",
      "And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; (for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:)\n",
      "And the name of the other was Eliezer; (for the God of my father, said he, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:)\n",
      "And Jethro, Moses\\'s father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:\n",
      "And he said to Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro have come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.\n",
      "And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare: and they came into the tent.\n",
      "And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Israel\\'s sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.\n",
      "And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.\n",
      "And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\n",
      "Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing in which they dealt proudly, he was above them.\n",
      "And Jethro, Moses\\'s father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses\\'s father-in-law before God.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.\n",
      "And when Moses\\'s father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning to evening?\n",
      "And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God:\n",
      "When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between one and another, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.\n",
      "And Moses\\'s father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou doest is not good.\n",
      "Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.\n",
      "Hearken now to my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people toward God, that thou mayest bring the causes to God:\n",
      "And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.\n",
      "Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:\n",
      "And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to thee, but every small matter they shall judge: So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.\n",
      "If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.\n",
      "So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.\n",
      "And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.\n",
      "And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n",
      "And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.\n",
      "In the third month, when the children of Israel had gone forth from the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.\n",
      "For they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.\n",
      "And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;\n",
      "Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles\\' wings, and brought you to myself.\n",
      "Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:\n",
      "And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.\n",
      "And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes,\n",
      "And be ready against the third day: for on the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.\n",
      "And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up upon the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:\n",
      "There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through: whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\n",
      "And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.\n",
      "And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that were in the camp trembled.\n",
      "And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.\n",
      "And mount Sinai was altogether in a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount trembled greatly.\n",
      "And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.\n",
      "And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.\n",
      "And let the priests also who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Away, go down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: But let not the priests and the people break through, to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.\n",
      "So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.\n",

      "They have turned aside quickly from the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold it is a stiff-necked people:\n",
      "Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.\n",
      "And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why [] thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast [] forth from the land of Egypt, with great power, and with [] mighty hand?\n",
      "Why should the Egyptians speak and say, For evil did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.\n",
      "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thine own self, and saidst to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.\n",
      "And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.\n",
      "And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.\n",
      "And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.\n",
      "And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.\n",
      "And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.\n",
      "And it came to pass as soon as he came nigh to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses\\'s anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables from his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.\n",
      "And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.\n",
      "And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?\n",
      "And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people that they are set on mischief.\n",
      "For they said to me, Make us gods which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.\n",
      "And I said to them, Whoever hath any gold, let them break it off: So they gave it to me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.\n",
      "And when Moses saw that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame, among their enemies:)\n",
      "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD\\'S side? let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi assembled themselves to him.\n",
      "And he said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.\n",
      "And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\n",
      "For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to the LORD; it may be I shall make an atonement for your sin.\n",
      "And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.\n",
      "Yet now, if thou wilt, forgive their sin: and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.\n",
      "Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to thee: Behold, my angel shall go before thee: Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.\n",
      "And the LORD afflicted the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Depart and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast conducted from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, to thy seed will I give it:\n",
      "And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:\n",
      "To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiff-necked people: lest I consume thee in the way.\n",
      "And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man put on him his ornaments.\n",
      "For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do to thee.\n",
      "And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, by the mount Horeb.\n",
      "And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp far from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one who sought the LORD, went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.\n",
      "And it came to pass when Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose, and stood every man at his tent-door, and looked after Moses, until he had gone into the tabernacle.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses.\n",
      "And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose and worshiped, every man in his tent-door.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend. And he turned again into the camp; but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, See, thou sayest to me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.\n",
      "And he said, My presence shall attend thee, and I will give thee rest.\n",
      "And he said to him, If thy presence shall not attend me, conduct us not hence.\n",
      "For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.\n",
      "And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory.\n",
      "And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.\n",
      "And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock: and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:\n",
      "And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first; and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst break.\n",
      "And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.\n",
      "And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount: neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.\n",
      "And he hewed two tables of stone, like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.\n",
      "And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.\n",
      "Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children\\'s children, to the third and to the fourth generation.\n",
      "And Moses made haste, and bowed his head towards the earth, and worshiped.\n",
      "And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us (for it is a stiff-necked people) and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thy inheritance.\n",
      "And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art, shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.\n",
      "Observe thou that which I command thee this day: Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\n",
      "Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:\n",
      "But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves.\n",
      "For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:\n",
      "Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;\n",
      "And thou take of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods.\n",
      "Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.\n",
      "The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out of from Egypt.\n",
      "Every first-born is mine: and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.\n",
      "But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou shalt not redeem him, then shalt thou break his neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.\n",
      "Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in time of plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest.\n",
      "And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of in-gathering at the year\\'s end.\n",
      "Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.\n",
      "For I will drive out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God, thrice in the year.\n",
      "Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning.\n",
      "The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother\\'s milk.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee, and with Israel.\n",
      "And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water: and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.\n",
      "And it came to pass when Moses came down from mount Sinai (with the two tables of testimony in Moses\\'s hand, when he came down from the mount) that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone, while he talked with him.\n",
      "And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him.\n",
      "And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them.\n",
      "And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.\n",
      "And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.\n",
      "But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.\n",
      "And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses\\'s face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.\n",
      "And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.\n",
      "Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever doth work therein shall be put to death.\n",
      "Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath-day.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,\n",
      "Take ye from among you an offering to the LORD: whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,\n",
      "And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats\\' hair,\n",
      "And rams\\' skins dyed red, and badgers\\' skins, and shittim wood,\n",
      "And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,\n",
      "And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breast-plate.\n",
      "And every wise-hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;\n",
      "The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its buttons, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,\n",
      "The ark, and its staffs, with the mercy-seat, and the vail of the covering,\n",
      "The table, and its staffs, and all its vessels, and the show-bread,\n",
      "The candlestick also for the light, and its furniture, and its lamps, with the oil for the light,\n",
      "And the incense-altar, and its staffs, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle,\n",
      "The altar of burnt-offering, with its brazen grate, its staffs, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot,\n",
      "The hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,\n",
      "The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,\n",
      "The clothes of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest\\'s office.\n",
      "And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.\n",
      "And they came, every one whose heart excited him, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD\\'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.\n",
      "And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought bracelets, and ear-rings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold; and every man that offered, offered an offering of gold to the LORD.\n",
      "And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats\\' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers\\' skins, brought them.\n",
      "Every one that offered an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD\\'S offering: and every man with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.\n",
      "And all the women that were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.\n",
      "And all the women whose heart moved them in wisdom spun goats\\' hair.\n",
      "And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breast-plate;\n",
      "And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.\n",
      "The children of Israel brought a willing offering to the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;\n",
      "And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;\n",
      "And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,\n",
      "And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of curious work.\n",
      "And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\n",
      "Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the skillful workmen, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise curious work.\n",
      "Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding, to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.\n",
      "And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart excited him to come to the work to do it:\n",
      "And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they brought yet to him free-offerings every morning.\n",
      "And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made.\n",
      "And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.\n",
      "And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.\n",
      "For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.\n",
      "And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: he made them with cherubim of curious work.\n",
      "The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.\n",
      "And he coupled the five curtains one to another: and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.\n",
      "And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the extremity of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.\n",
      "Fifty loops he made in one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.\n",
      "And he made fifty buttons of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the buttons. So it became one tabernacle.\n",
      "And he made curtains of goats\\' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.\n",
      "The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.\n",
      "And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.\n",
      "And he made fifty loops upon the outermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.\n",
      "And he made fifty buttons of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.\n",
      "And he made a covering for the tent of rams\\' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers\\' skins above that.\n",
      "And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.\n",
      "The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.\n",
      "One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another; thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.\n",
      "And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:\n",
      "And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.\n",
      "And for the other side of the tabernacle which is towards the north corner, he made twenty boards.\n",
      "And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.\n",
      "And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.\n",
      "And two boards he made for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.\n",
      "And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.\n",
      "And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.\n",
      "And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,\n",
      "And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.\n",
      "And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.\n",
      "And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.\n",
      "And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim he made it of curious work.\n",
      "And he made to it four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.\n",
      "And he made a hanging for the tabernacle-door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needle-work;\n",
      "And the five pillars of it, with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.\n",
      "And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the hight of it:\n",
      "And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.\n",
      "And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.\n",
      "And he made staffs of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.\n",
      "And he put the staffs into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.\n",
      "And he made the mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and one cubit and a half the breadth of it.\n",
      "And he made two cherubim of gold, beaten out of one piece he made them, on the two ends of the mercy-seat;\n",
      "One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy-seat made he the cherubim on the two ends of it.\n",
      "And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy-seat, with their faces one to another; even towards the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.\n",
      "And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its hight:\n",
      "And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made to it a crown of gold round about.\n",
      "Also he made to it a border of a hand-breadth round about; and made a crown of gold for its border round about.\n",
      "And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in its four feet.\n",
      "Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staffs, to bear the table.\n",
      "And he made the staffs of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.\n",
      "And he made the vessels which were upon the table, its dishes, and its spoons, and its bowls, and its covers to cover with, of pure gold.\n",
      "And he made the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work he made the candlestick; its shaft, and its branch, its bowls, its knobs, and its flowers were of the same:\n",
      "And six branches proceeding from its sides; three branches of the candlestick from the one side of it, and three branches of the candlestick from the other side of it.\n",
      "Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knob and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knob and a flower: so throughout the six branches proceeding from the candlestick.\n",
      "And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, its knobs, and its flowers:\n",
      "And a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, according to the six branches proceeding from it.\n",
      "Their knobs and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.\n",
      "And he made its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, of pure gold.\n",
      "Of a talent of pure gold he made it, and all its vessels.\n",
      "And he made the incense-altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the hight of it; the horns of it were of the same.\n",
      "And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and its sides round about, and its horns: also he made to it a crown of gold round about.\n",
      "And he made two rings of gold for it under its crown, by the two corners of it, upon its two sides, to be places for the staffs to bear it with.\n",
      "And he made the staffs of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.\n",
      "And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.\n",
      "And he made the altar of burnt-offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length of it, and five cubits the breadth of it; it was foursquare; and its hight was three cubits.\n",
      "And he made its horns on the four corners of it; its horns were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.\n",
      "And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, and the flesh-hooks, and the fire-pans: all the vessels of it he made of brass.\n",
      "And he made for the altar a brazen grate of net-work under the compass of it beneath to the midst of it.\n",
      "And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staffs.\n",
      "And he made the staffs of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.\n",
      "And he put the staffs into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it with; he made the altar hollow with boards.\n",
      "And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the looking-glasses of the women assembling, who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits:\n",
      "Their pillars were twenty, and their brazen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, were of silver.\n",
      "And for the north side, the hangings were a hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty: the hooks of the pillars, and their filets, of silver.\n",

      "And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.\n",
      "And the hanging for the gate of the court was needle-work, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the hight in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.\n",
      "And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets of silver.\n",
      "And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.\n",
      "This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.\n",
      "And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.\n",
      "All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.\n",
      "And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and seventy five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:\n",
      "A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.\n",
      "And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; a hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.\n",
      "And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and filleted them.\n",
      "And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.\n",
      "And with this he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,\n",
      "And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.\n",
      "And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made clothes of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.\n",
      "And they beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with curious work.\n",
      "They made shoulder-pieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.\n",
      "And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he made the breast-plate of curious work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.\n",
      "It was foursquare; they made the breast-plate double: a span was the length of it, and a span the breadth of it, being doubled.\n",
      "And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.\n",
      "And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.\n",
      "And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.\n",
      "And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.\n",
      "And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.\n",
      "And they made upon the breast-plate chains at the ends, of wreathed work of pure gold.\n",
      "And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings in the two ends of the breast-plate.\n",
      "And they put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breast-plate.\n",
      "And the two ends of the two wreathed chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, before it.\n",
      "And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breast-plate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.\n",
      "And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, towards the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod:\n",
      "And they bound the breast-plate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breast-plate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.\n",
      "And there was a hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band around the hole, that it should not rend.\n",
      "And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.\n",
      "And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, around between the pomegranates;\n",
      "A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And they made coats of fine linen, of woven work, for Aaron and for his sons,\n",
      "And a miter of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,\n",
      "And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needle-work; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.\n",
      "And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the miter; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.\n",
      "And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, and all its furniture, its buttons, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets,\n",
      "And the covering of rams\\' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers\\' skins, and the vail of the covering,\n",
      "The ark of the testimony, and its staffs, and the mercy-seat,\n",
      "The table, and all its vessels, and the show-bread,\n",
      "The pure candlestick, with its lamps, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all its vessels, and the oil for light,\n",
      "And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle-door,\n",
      "The brazen altar, and its grate of brass, its staffs, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot,\n",
      "The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the hanging for the court-gate, its cords, and its pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,\n",
      "The clothes of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons\\' garments, to minister in the priest\\'s office.\n",
      "According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.\n",
      "And Moses looked upon all the work, and behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.\n",
      "And thou shalt put in it the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.\n",
      "And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light its lamps.\n",
      "And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.\n",
      "And thou shalt set the altar of the, burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.\n",
      "And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water in it.\n",
      "And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court-gate.\n",
      "And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shalt hallow it, and all its vessels: and it shall be holy.\n",
      "And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.\n",
      "And thou shalt anoint the laver and its foot, and sanctify it.\n",
      "And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.\n",
      "And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister to me in the priest\\'s office.\n",
      "And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:\n",
      "And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest\\'s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.\n",
      "Thus did Moses; according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.\n",
      "And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and reared up its pillars.\n",
      "And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staffs on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:\n",
      "And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.\n",
      "And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.\n",
      "And he lighted the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation, before the vail:\n",
      "And he burnt sweet incense on it; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.\n",
      "And he put the altar of burnt-offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash with.\n",
      "And Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, washed their hands and their feet thereat:\n",
      "When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court-gate: so Moses finished the work.\n",
      "Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.\n",
      "And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.\n",
      "And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:\n",
      "But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.\n",
      "For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.\n",
      "And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man of you shall bring an offering to the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.\n",
      "If his offering shall be a burnt-sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.\n",
      "And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.\n",
      "And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron\\'s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood around upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces,\n",
      "And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire.\n",
      "And the priests, Aaron\\'s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar.\n",
      "But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt-sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.\n",
      "And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.\n",
      "And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron\\'s sons, shall sprinkle his blood around upon the altar:\n",
      "And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:\n",
      "But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.\n",
      "And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD shall be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle doves, or of young pigeons.\n",
      "And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar: and its blood shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:\n",
      "And he shall pluck away its crop with its feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:\n",
      "And he shall cleave it with its wings, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.\n",
      "And when any will offer a meat-offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it.\n",
      "And he shall bring it to Aaron\\'s sons the priests: and he shall take out of it his handful of its flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD:\n",
      "And the remnant of the meat-offering shall be Aaron\\'s and his sons\\': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.\n",
      "And if thou shalt bring an oblation of a meat-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.\n",
      "And if thy oblation shall be a meat-offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.\n",
      "Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil upon it: it is a meat-offering.\n",
      "And if thy oblation shall be a meat-offering baked in the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.\n",
      "And thou shalt bring the meat-offering that is made of these things to the LORD: and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.\n",
      "And the priest shall take from the meat-offering a memorial of it, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.\n",
      "And that which is left of the meat-offering shall be Aaron\\'s and his sons\\': it is a thing most holy, of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.\n",
      "No meat-offering which ye shall bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.\n",
      "As for the oblation of the first-fruits, ye shall offer them to the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savor.\n",
      "And every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt: neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offering: with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt.\n",
      "And if thou shalt offer a meat-offering of thy first-fruits to the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat-offering of thy first-fruits, green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.\n",
      "And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense upon it: it is a meat-offering.\n",
      "And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of its beaten corn, and part of its oil, with all its frankincense: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",
      "And if his oblation shall be a sacrifice of peace-offering, if he shall offer it of the herd, whether a male or female; he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.\n",
      "And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron\\'s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.\n",
      "And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace-offering, an offering made by fire to the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,\n",
      "And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.\n",
      "And Aaron\\'s sons shall burn it on the altar, upon the burnt-sacrifice which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.\n",
      "And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offering to the LORD shall be of the flock, male or female; he shall offer it without blemish.\n",
      "If he shall offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD.\n",
      "And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron\\'s sons shall sprinkle the blood of it around upon the altar.\n",
      "And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace-offering an offering made by fire to the LORD: its fat, and the whole rump, that shall he take off hard by the back-bone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,\n",
      "And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, that shall he take away.\n",
      "And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",

      "It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall violate any of them:\n",
      "If the priest that is anointed shall sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring, for his sin which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin-offering.\n",
      "And he shall bring the bullock to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock\\'s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.\n",

      "And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin-offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,\n",
      "And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, that shall he take away,\n",
      "As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt-offering.\n",
      "And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,\n",
      "Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.\n",
      "And if the whole congregation of Israel shall sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;\n",

      "And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken to them by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat-offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:\n",
      "And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons\\' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.\n",
      "And the wave-breast and heave-shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are thy due, and thy sons\\' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the children of Israel.\n",
      "The heave-shoulder and the wave-breast shall they bring, with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons\\' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.\n",
      "And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left alive, saying,\n",
      "Why have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?\n",
      "Behold, the blood of it was not brought within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.\n",
      "And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering, and their burnt-offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to day, would it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?\n",
      "And when Moses heard that, he was content.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them.\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.\n",
      "Whatever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that shall ye eat.\n",

      "And if the bright spot shall stay in its place, and not spread in the skin, but be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.\n",
      "If a man or woman shall have a plague upon the head or the beard;\n",
      "Then the priest shall see the plague: and behold, if it is in sight deeper than the skin, and there is in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.\n",
      "And if the priest shall look on the plague of the scall, and behold, it is not in sight deeper than the skin, and no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:\n",

      "But if the scall shall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;\n",
      "Then the priest shall look on him: and behold, if the scall is spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.\n",
      "But if the scall shall be in his sight at a stay, and there is black hair grown in it; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\n",
      "If a man also or a woman shall have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;\n",
      "Then the priest shall look: and behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh are darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.\n",
      "And the man whose hair hath fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.\n",
      "And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head towards his face, he is forehead-bald; yet is he clean.\n",
      "And if there is in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up on his bald head, or his bald forehead.\n",
      "Then the priest shall look upon it: and behold, if the rising of the sore is white reddish on his bald head, or on his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;\n",
      "He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.\n",

      "And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up that which hath the plague seven days:\n",
      "And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague is spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin: the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.\n",
      "He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or any thing of skin, in which the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.\n",
      "And if the priest shall look, and behold, the plague is not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;\n",
      "Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:\n",

      "And if the priest shall look, and behold, the plague is somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:\n",
      "And if it shall appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that in which the plague is, with fire.\n",
      "And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatever thing of skin it is, which thou shalt wash, if the plague hath departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.\n",
      "This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest:\n",

      "And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.\n",
      "And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.\n",
      "But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head, and his beard, and his eye-brows, even all his hair he shall shave off; and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.\n",

      "And when the sun is set, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things, because it is his food.\n",
      "That which dieth of itself, or is torn by beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself with it: I am the LORD.\n",
      "They shall therefore keep my ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.\n",
      "There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.\n",
      "But if the priest shall buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.\n",
      "If the priest\\'s daughter also shall be married to a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.\n",
      "But if the priest\\'s daughter shall be a widow, or divorced, and shall have no child, and have returned to her father\\'s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father\\'s meat; but there shall no stranger eat of it.\n",
      "And if a man shall eat of the holy thing unknowingly, then he shall put to it the fifth part, and shall give it to the priest, with the holy thing.\n",
      "And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which they offer to the LORD;\n",
      "Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whoever he may be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his free-will-offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt-offering:\n",

      "And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.\n",
      "And ye shall offer, that day when ye wave the sheaf, a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering to the LORD.\n",
      "And the meat-offering thereof shall be two tenth-parts of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to the LORD for a sweet savor: and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.\n",
      "And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the same day that ye have brought an offering to your God: It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.\n",

      "After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:\n",
      "Either his uncle, or his uncle\\'s son may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin to him of his family, may redeem him; or if he is able, he may redeem himself.\n",
      "And he shall reckon with him that bought him, from the year that he was sold to him, to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him.\n",
      "If there shall be yet many years behind, according to them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.\n",
      "And if there shall remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.\n",
      "And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.\n",
      "And if he shall not be redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him.\n",
      "For to me the children of Israel are servants, they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.\n",

      "And your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.\n",
      "And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid the land of evil beasts, neither shall the sword go through your land.\n",
      "And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.\n",
      "And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.\n",
      "For I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.\n",

      "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bond-men, and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.\n",
      "But if ye will not hearken to me, and will not do all these commandments;\n",
      "And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul shall abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:\n",
      "I also will do this to you, I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.\n",
      "And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you, and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.\n",
      "And if ye will not yet for all this hearken to me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.\n",
      "And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:\n",
      "And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.\n",
      "And if ye shall walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.\n",
      "I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, and your high-ways shall be desolate.\n",
      "And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;\n",
      "Then will I also walk contrary to you, and I will punish you yet seven times for your sins.\n",
      "And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you: and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.\n",
      "And when I have broke the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.\n",
      "And if ye will not for all this hearken to me, but walk contrary to me;\n",
      "Then I will walk contrary to you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.\n",
      "And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.\n",
      "And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.\n",
      "And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.\n",
      "And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.\n",
      "And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.\n",
      "Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies\\' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.\n",
      "As long as it lieth desolate, it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.\n",
      "And upon them that are left alive of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall, when none pursueth.\n",

      "And a man shall lie with her carnally, and it shall be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;\n",
      "And the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:\n",
      "Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense upon it; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.\n",
      "And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:\n",
      "And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:\n",

      "And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to perish. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.\n",

      "He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.\n",
      "All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine-tree, from the kernels even to the husk.\n",
      "All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days shall be fulfilled, in which he separateth himself to the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.\n",
      "All the days that he separateth himself to the LORD, he shall come at no dead body.\n",
      "He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head.\n",
      "All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.\n",
      "And if any man shall die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.\n",
      "And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:\n",
      "And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.\n",
      "And he shall consecrate to the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass-offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.\n",
      "And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:\n",
      "And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,\n",
      "And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat-offering and their drink-offerings.\n",
      "And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:\n",
      "And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat-offering, and his drink-offering.\n",
      "And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offerings.\n",
      "And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:\n",
      "And the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave-breast, and heave-shoulder: and after that, the Nazarite may drink wine.\n",
      "This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering to the LORD for his separation, besides that which his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,\n",
      "The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:\n",
      "The LORD make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious to thee:\n",
      "The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.\n",
      "And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all its instruments, both the altar and all its vessels, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;\n",
      "That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:\n",

      "And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.\n",

      "For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them to me.\n",
      "For all the first born of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.\n",
      "And I have taken the Levites for all the first-born of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there may be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh to the sanctuary.\n",
      "And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel to them.\n",
      "And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.\n",
      "And after that went the Levites in to perform their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they to them.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "This is it that belongeth to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:\n",
      "And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service of it, and shall serve no more:\n",
      "But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do to the Levites concerning their charge.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,\n",
      "Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at its appointed season.\n",
      "In the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all its rites, and according to all its ceremonies, shall ye keep it.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.\n",
      "And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at evening in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.\n",
      "And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:\n",
      "And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?\n",
      "And Moses said to them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover to the LORD.\n",
      "The fourteenth day of the second month at evening, they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.\n",
      "They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.\n",
      "But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.\n",
      "And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover to the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner of it, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.\n",
      "And on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at evening there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.\n",
      "So it was always; the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.\n",
      "And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.\n",
      "At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.\n",
      "And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.\n",
      "And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.\n",
      "And so it was, when the cloud abode from evening to the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.\n",
      "Or whether it was two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining upon it, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.\n",
      "At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them; that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.\n",
      "And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, who are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall assemble themselves to thee.\n",
      "When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.\n",
      "When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.\n",
      "But when the congregation is to be convened, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.\n",
      "And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.\n",
      "And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.\n",
      "Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.\n",
      "And the children of Israel took their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.\n",
      "And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.\n",
      "And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.\n",
      "And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.\n",
      "And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari moved forward, bearing the tabernacle.\n",
      "And the standard of the camp of Reuben moved forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.\n",
      "And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.\n",
      "And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.\n",
      "And the Kohathites moved forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other set up the tabernacle against they came.\n",
      "And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim moved forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.\n",
      "And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.\n",
      "And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.\n",
      "And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan moved forward, which was the rear-ward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.\n",
      "And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.\n",
      "And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.\n",
      "Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they moved forward.\n",
      "And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses\\'s father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it to you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.\n",
      "And he said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.\n",
      "And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.\n",
      "And it shall be, if thou wilt go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do to us, the same will we do to thee.\n",
      "And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days\\' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days\\' journey, to seek a resting-place for them.\n",
      "And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the ark moved forward, that Moses said, Arise, LORD, and let thy enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.\n",
      "And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.\n",
      "And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD; and the LORD heard it: and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.\n",
      "And the people cried to Moses; and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched.\n",
      "And he called the name of the place Taberah; because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.\n",
      "And the mixed multitude that was among them fell to lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?\n",
      "We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt freely: the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:\n",
      "But now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all, besides this manna, before our eyes.\n",
      "And the manna was as coriander-seed, and the color of it as the color of bdellium.\n",
      "And the people went about, and gathered it and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.\n",
      "And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.\n",
      "Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly: Moses also was displeased.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? and why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?\n",
      "Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father beareth the sucking child, to the land which thou sworest to their fathers?\n",
      "Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.\n",
      "I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.\n",
      "And if thou dealest thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.\n",
      "And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou mayest not bear it thyself alone.\n",
      "And say thou to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.\n",
      "Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;\n",
      "But even a whole month, until it shall come out at your nostrils, and it be lothsome to you; because ye have despised the LORD who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?\n",
      "And Moses said, The people among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.\n",
      "Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice for them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to suffice for them?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD\\'S hand shortened? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass to thee, or not.\n",
      "And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the tabernacle.\n",
      "And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that when the spirit rested upon them; they prophesied, and did not cease.\n",
      "But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them, and they were of them that were described, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.\n",
      "And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord, Moses, forbid them.\n",
      "And Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? I would that all the LORD\\'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them.\n",
      "And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.\n",
      "And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day\\'s journey on this side, and as it were a day\\'s journey on the other side, around the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.\n",
      "And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp.\n",
      "And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.\n",
      "And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.\n",
      "And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth: and abode at Hazeroth.\n",
      "And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married: for he had married a Cushite woman.\n",
      "And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoke only by Moses? hath he not spoke also by us? And the LORD heard it.\n",
      "(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men who were upon the face of the earth.)\n",
      "And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three to the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.\n",
      "And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.\n",
      "And he said, Hear now my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.\n",
      "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.\n",
      "With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.\n",
      "And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.\n",
      "And Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.\n",
      "Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed at the time of his birth.\n",
      "And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received again.\n",
      "And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.\n",
      "And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.\n",
      "And Moses, by the commandment of the LORD, sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manassah, Gaddi the son of Susi.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.\n",
      "These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.\n",
      "And Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go ye up this way southward, and ascend the mountain:\n",
      "And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, few or many;\n",
      "And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;\n",
      "And what the land is, whether it is fertile or barren, whether there is wood in it, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.\n",
      "So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.\n",
      "And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)\n",
      "And they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.\n",
      "The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.\n",
      "And they returned from exploring the land after forty days.\n",
      "And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.\n",
      "And they told him, and said, We came to the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the people are strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.\n",
      "The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.\n",
      "And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.\n",
      "But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.\n",
      "And they brought an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have passed to search it, is a land that eateth up its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it, are men of a great stature.\n",
      "And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, who come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\n",
      "And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.\n",
      "And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, O that we had died in the land of Egypt! or O that we had died in this wilderness!\n",
      "And why hath the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?\n",
      "And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.\n",
      "Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:\n",
      "And they spoke to all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.\n",
      "If the LORD delighteth in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.\n",
      "Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense has departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.\n",
      "But all the congregation required to stone them with stones: and the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shown among them?\n",
      "I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians will hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)\n",
      "And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day-time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.\n",
      "Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,\n",
      "Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.\n",
      "And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,\n",
      "The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation.\n",
      "Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt, even until now.\n",
      "And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:\n",
      "But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.\n",
      "Because all those men who have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;\n",
      "Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:\n",
      "But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.\n",
      "(Now the Amalekites, and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To-morrow turn you, and pass into the wilderness, by the way of the Red sea.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n",
      "How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.\n",
      "Say to them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:\n",
      "Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,\n",
      "Doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.\n",
      "But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.\n",
      "But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.\n",
      "And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your lewd deeds, until your carcasses shall be wasted in the wilderness.\n",
      "After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days (each day for a year) shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.\n",
      "I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered against me: in this wilderness, they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.\n",
      "And the men whom Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing a slander upon the land,\n",
      "Even those men that brought the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.\n",
      "But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.\n",
      "And Moses told these sayings to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.\n",
      "And they rose early in the morning, and ascended to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up to the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.\n",
      "And Moses said, Why now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.\n",
      "Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.\n",
      "For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.\n",
      "But they presumed to go up to the hill-top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.\n",
      "Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye shall have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,\n",
      "And will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a free-will-offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savor to the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock:\n",
      "Then shall he that offereth his offering to the LORD bring a meat-offering of a tenth part of flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil.\n",
      "And the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.\n",
      "Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat-offering two tenth parts of flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil.\n",
      "And for a drink-offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine, for a sweet savor to the LORD.\n",
      "And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace-offerings to the LORD:\n",
      "Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat-offering of three tenth parts of flour mingled with half a hin of oil.\n",
      "And thou shalt bring for a drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD:\n",
      "Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.\n",
      "According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.\n",
      "All that are born in the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.\n",
      "And if a stranger shall sojourn with you, or whoever shall be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.\n",
      "One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.\n",
      "One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,\n",
      "Then it shall be, that when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering to the LORD.\n",
      "Ye shall offer a cake of the first of your dough for a heave-offering: as ye do the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.\n",
      "Of the first of your dough ye shall give to the LORD a heave-offering in your generations.\n",
      "And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments which the LORD hath spoken to Moses,\n",
      "Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;\n",
      "Then it shall be, if aught shall be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor to the LORD, with his meat-offering, and his drink-offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.\n",
      "And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin-offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:\n",
      "And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.\n",
      "And if any soul shall sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she-goat of the first year for a sin-offering.\n",
      "And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.\n",
      "Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.\n",
      "But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\n",
      "Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.\n",
      "And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath-day.\n",
      "And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.\n",
      "And they put him in custody, because it was not declared what should be done to him.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.\n",
      "And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribin of blue:\n",
      "And it shall be to you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray:\n",
      "That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.\n",
      "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:\n",
      "And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:\n",
      "And they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: why then do ye raise yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?\n",
      "And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:\n",
      "And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to-morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near to him.\n",
      "This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;\n",
      "And put fire in them, and put incense in them before the LORD to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.\n",
      "And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:\n",
      "Seemeth it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?\n",
      "And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?\n",
      "For which cause both thou and all thy company are assembled against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?\n",
      "And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: who said, We will not come up:\n",
      "Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?\n",
      "Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.\n",
      "And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.\n",
      "And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:\n",
      "And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also and Aaron each of you his censer.\n",
      "And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on them, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.\n",
      "And Korah gathered all the congregation against them to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n",
      "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.\n",
      "And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the congregation, saying, Withdraw yourselves from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.\n",
      "And Moses rose up, and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.\n",
      "And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.\n",
      "So they withdrew from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.\n",
      "And Moses said, by this ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works: for I have not done them of my own mind.\n",
      "If these men shall die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.\n",
      "But if the LORD shall make a new thing, and the earth shall open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground cleaved asunder that was under them:\n",
      "And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.\n",
      "They, and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.\n",
      "And all Israel that were round about them, fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.\n",
      "And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.\n",
      "The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:\n",
      "To be a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he may not be as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked towards the tabernacle of the congregation: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Remove from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.\n",
      "And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.\n",
      "And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.\n",
      "And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.\n",
      "Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.\n",
      "And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: write thou every man\\'s name upon his rod.\n",
      "And thou shalt write Aaron\\'s name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.\n",
      "And thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that the man\\'s rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, by which they murmur against you.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers\\' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.\n",
      "And Moses laid the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.\n",
      "And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron\\'s rod again, before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.\n",
      "And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.\n",
      "And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.\n",
      "Whoever approacheth the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father\\'s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.\n",
      "And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined to thee, and minister to thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.\n",
      "And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.\n",
      "And they shall be joined to thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh to you.\n",
      "And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.\n",
      "And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest\\'s office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest\\'s office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.\n",
      "This shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.\n",
      "In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to thee.\n",
      "And this is thine; the heave-offering of their gift, with all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.\n",
      "All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given to thee.\n",
      "And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.\n",
      "Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.\n",
      "Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether of men or beast, shall be thine: nevertheless, the first born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.\n",
      "And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thy estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.\n",
      "But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to the LORD.\n",
      "And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right shoulder are thine\n",
      "All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given to thee, and to thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to thee and to thy seed with thee.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thy inheritance among the children of Israel.\n",
      "And behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.\n",
      "But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.\n",
      "But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.\n",
      "And this your heave-offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the wine-press.\n",
      "Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering to the LORD of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them the LORD\\'S heave-offering to Aaron the priest.\n",
      "Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of the LORD, of all the best of it, even its hallowed part out of it.\n",
      "Therefore thou shalt say to them, When ye have heaved from it the best of it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.\n",
      "And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n",
      "This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish, and upon which never came a yoke:\n",
      "And ye shall give her to Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:\n",
      "And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:\n",
      "And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:\n",
      "And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.\n",
      "Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.\n",
      "And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.\n",
      "And a man that is clean shall gather the ashes of the heifer, and lay them without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel, for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.\n",
      "And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.\n",
      "He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.\n",
      "He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he shall not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.\n",
      "Whoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.\n",
      "This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.\n",
      "And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.\n",
      "And whoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.\n",
      "And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put to it in a vessel:\n",
      "And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:\n",
      "And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.\n",
      "But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him: he is unclean.\n",
      "And it shall be a perpetual statute to them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until the evening.\n",
      "And whatever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until the evening.\n",
      "Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.\n",
      "And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron.\n",
      "And the people chid with Moses, and spoke, saying, O that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!\n",
      "And why have ye brought the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?\n",
      "And why have ye conducted us from Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Take the rod, and convene thou the assembly, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye to the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth its water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give drink to the congregation and their beasts.\n",
      "And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?\n",
      "And Moses lifted his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.\n",
      "This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.\n",
      "And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:\n",
      "How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians afflicted us, and our fathers:\n",
      "And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth from Egypt: and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:\n",
      "Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king\\'s high-way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.\n",
      "And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the highway: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet.\n",
      "And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.\n",
      "Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.\n",
      "And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came to mount Hor.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,\n",
      "Aaron shall be gathered to his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.\n",
      "Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor:\n",
      "And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there.\n",
      "And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they ascended mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.\n",
      "And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.\n",
      "And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.\n",
      "And when king Arad the Canaanite, who dwelt in the south, heard that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.\n",
      "And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.\n",
      "And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.\n",
      "And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.\n",
      "And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul lotheth this light bread.\n",
      "And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.\n",
      "Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.\n",
      "And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.\n",
      "And the children of Israel moved forward, and pitched in Oboth.\n",
      "And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, towards the sun-rising.\n",
      "From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.\n",
      "From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.\n",
      "Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,\n",
      "And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.\n",
      "And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well of which the LORD spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them water.\n",
      "Then Israel sung this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye to it:\n",
      "The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staffs. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:\n",
      "And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:\n",
      "And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh towards Jeshimon.\n",
      "And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,\n",
      "Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king\\'s high-way, until we have past thy borders.\n",
      "And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel:\n",
      "And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.\n",
      "And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.\n",
      "For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.\n",
      "Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared.\n",
      "For there has a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.\n",
      "Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.\n",
      "We have shot at them; Heshbon has perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which reacheth to Medeba.\n",
      "Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.\n",
      "And Moses sent to explore Jaazer, and they took its villages, and drove out the Amorites that were there.\n",
      "And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.\n",
      "So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left to him alive: and they possessed his land.\n",
      "And the children of Israel moved forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side of Jordan by Jericho.\n",
      "And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.\n",
      "And Moab was greatly afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are around us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.\n",
      "He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there has a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:\n",
      "Come now therefore, I pray thee, Curse for me this people; for they are too mighty for me: it may be I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.\n",
      "And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.\n",
      "And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak to me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.\n",
      "And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?\n",
      "And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent to me, saying,\n",
      "Behold, there has a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse them for me: it may be I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.\n",
      "And God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.\n",
      "And Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Depart into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.\n",
      "And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.\n",
      "And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.\n",
      "And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming to me:\n",
      "For I will promote thee to very great honor, and I will do whatever thou sayest to me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse this people for me.\n",
      "And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more.\n",
      "And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call thee, rise and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to thee, that shalt thou perform.\n",
      "And Balaam rose in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.\n",
      "And God\\'s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.\n",
      "And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.\n",
      "But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.\n",
      "And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam\\'s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.\n",
      "And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam\\'s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.\n",
      "And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?\n",
      "And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee.\n",
      "And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I thy ass, upon which thou hast rid ever since I was thine to this day? was I ever wont to do so to thee? And he said, Nay.\n",
      "Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why hast thou smitten thy ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:\n",
      "And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.\n",
      "And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displeaseth thee, I will return again.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to thee, that thou shalt speak: So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.\n",
      "And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost limit.\n",
      "And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? why camest thou not to me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I have come to thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.\n",
      "And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath-huzoth.\n",
      "And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and conducted him to the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.\n",
      "And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: it may be the LORD will come to meet me: and whatever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a high place.\n",
      "And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.\n",
      "And the LORD put a word in Balaam\\'s mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.\n",
      "And he returned to him and lo, he stood by his burnt-sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, defy Israel.\n",
      "How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?\n",
      "For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.\n",
      "Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!\n",
      "And Balak said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me? I took thee to curse my enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.\n",
      "And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?\n",
      "And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and from thence curse them for me.\n",
      "And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.\n",
      "And he said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.\n",
      "And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak, and say thus.\n",
      "And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What hath the LORD spoken?\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Rise, Balak, and hear; hearken to me, thou son of Zippor:\n",
      "God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoke, and shall he not make it good?\n",
      "Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.\n",
      "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel; the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.\n",
      "God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn.\n",
      "Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!\n",
      "Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he shall eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.\n",
      "And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.\n",
      "But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?\n",
      "And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee to another place; perhaps it will please God that thou mayest from thence curse them for me.\n",
      "And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looketh towards Jeshimon.\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.\n",
      "And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.\n",
      "And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.\n",
      "And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes, and the spirit of God came upon him.\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:\n",
      "He hath said, who heard the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:\n",
      "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!\n",
      "As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river\\'s side, as the trees of lign-aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar-trees beside the waters.\n",
      "He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.\n",
      "God brought him forth from Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.\n",
      "He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall rouse him? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.\n",
      "And Balak\\'s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.\n",
      "Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee to great honor; but lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honor.\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not speak also to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying,\n",
      "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?\n",
      "And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, I will advertise thee what this people will do to thy people in the latter days.\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:\n",
      "He hath said, who heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the Most High, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:\n",
      "I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.\n",
      "And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.\n",
      "Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.\n",
      "And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations, but his latter end shall be that he shall perish for ever.\n",
      "And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asher shall carry thee away captive.\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!\n",
      "And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Ashur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.\n",
      "And Balaam arose, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.\n",
      "And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit lewdness with the daughters of Moab.\n",
      "And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods: and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.\n",
      "And Israel joined himself to Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.\n",
      "And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined to Baal-peor.\n",
      "And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;\n",
      "And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly: So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.\n",
      "And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, (while he was zealous for my sake among them,) that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.\n",
      "Wherefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.\n",
      "And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.\n",
      "Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.\n",
      "And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Distress the Midianites, and smite them:\n",
      "For they distress you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian their sister, who was slain in the day of the plague for Peor\\'s sake.\n",
      "And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,\n",
      "Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers\\' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.\n",
      "And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,\n",
      "Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, who went forth from the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Reuben the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: Of Phallu, the family of the Phalluites:\n",

      "The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,\n",
      "Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,\n",
      "Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:\n",
      "Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.\n",
      "And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?\n",
      "And why discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?\n",
      "Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.\n",
      "For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.\n",
      "And the LORD\\'S anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,\n",
      "Surely none of the men that came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:\n",
      "Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD\\'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed.\n",
      "And behold, ye have risen up in your fathers\\' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD towards Israel.\n",
      "For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and he will destroy all this people.\n",
      "And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheep-folds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:\n",
      "But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities, because of the inhabitants of the land.\n",
      "We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.\n",
      "For we will not inherit with them on the other side of Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance hath fallen to us on this side of Jordan eastward.\n",
      "And Moses said to them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,\n",
      "And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,\n",
      "And the land shall be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.\n",
      "But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.\n",
      "Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.\n",
      "And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.\n",
      "Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:\n",
      "But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.\n",
      "So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:\n",
      "And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed for battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:\n",
      "But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said to thy servants, so will we do.\n",
      "We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.\n",
      "And Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with its cities in the borders, even the cities of the country around.\n",
      "And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,\n",
      "And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,\n",
      "And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities: and folds for sheep.\n",
      "And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,\n",
      "And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built.\n",
      "And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite who was in it.\n",
      "And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt in it.\n",
      "And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns, and called them Havoth-jair.\n",
      "And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.\n",
      "These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went forth from the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.\n",
      "And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.\n",
      "And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.\n",
      "For the Egyptians buried all their first-born, whom the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.\n",
      "And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.\n",
      "And they departed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.\n",
      "And they removed from Etham, and turned again to Pi-hahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they encamped before Migdol.\n",
      "And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days\\' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.\n",
      "And they removed from Marah, and came to Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm-trees; and they encamped there.\n",
      "And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.\n",
      "And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.\n",
      "And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.\n",
      "And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.\n",

      "And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;\n",
      "Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite demolish all their high places:\n",
      "And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell in it; for I have given you the land to possess it.\n",
      "And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man\\'s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.\n",
      "But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be prickles in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall harass you in the land in which ye dwell.\n",
      "Moreover, it shall come to pass, that I shall do to you as I thought to do to them.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Command the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with its borders.)\n",
      "Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the border of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:\n",
      "And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: its limit shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon:\n",
      "And the border shall form a circuit from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and the limits of it shall be at the sea.\n",
      "And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.\n",
      "And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall designate for you mount Hor:\n",
      "From mount Hor ye shall designate your border to the entrance of Hamath; and the limits of the border shall be at Zedad:\n",
      "And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the limits of it shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border.\n",
      "And ye shall designate your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham:\n",
      "And the limit shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:\n",

      "And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,\n",
      "Command the children of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also to the Levites suburbs for the cities around them.\n",
      "And they shall have the cities to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.\n",
      "And the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits on all sides.\n",
      "And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.\n",
      "And among the cities which ye shall give to the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the man-slayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.\n",
      "So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.\n",
      "And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;\n",
      "Then ye shall appoint for you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, who killeth any person at unawares.\n",
      "And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the man-slayer may not die, until he stands before the congregation in judgment.\n",
      "And of these cities which ye shall give, six cities shall ye have for refuge.\n",
      "Ye shall give three cities on this side of Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.\n",
      "These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.\n",
      "And if he shall smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he shall die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "And if he shall smite him by throwing a stone, by which he may die, and he shall die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "Or if he shall smite him with a hand-weapon of wood, with which he may die, and he shall die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "The avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.\n",
      "But if he shall thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying in wait, that he die.\n",
      "Or in enmity shall smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.\n",
      "But if he shall thrust him suddenly without enmity, or shall have cast upon him any thing without laying in wait,\n",
      "Or with any stone, by which a man may die, seeing him not, and shall cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:\n",
      "Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments:\n",
      "And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he had fled: and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.\n",
      "But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he had fled;\n",
      "And the avenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood shall kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:\n",
      "Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.\n",
      "So these things shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.\n",
      "Whoever killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.\n",
      "Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.\n",
      "And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that hath fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.\n",
      "So ye shall not pollute the land in which ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him that shed it.\n",
      "Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, in which I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:\n",
      "And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.\n",
      "And if they shall be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received: so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance.\n",
      "And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.\n",
      "And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.\n",
      "This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.\n",
      "So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.\n",
      "And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.\n",
      "Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.\n",
      "Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:\n",
      "For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father\\'s brothers\\' sons:\n",
      "And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.\n",
      "These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.\n",
      "These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on the east side of Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against Suf, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.\n",
      "(There are eleven days journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.)\n",
      "And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;\n",
      "After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:\n",
      "On the east side of Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,\n",
      "The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:\n",
      "Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and to all the places nigh to it, in the plain, on the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea-side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates.\n",
      "Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.\n",
      "And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:\n",
      "The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.\n",
      "(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)\n",
      "How can I alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?\n",
      "Take ye wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.\n",
      "And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.\n",
      "So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.\n",
      "And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.\n",
      "Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God\\'s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.\n",
      "And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.\n",
      "And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.\n",
      "And I said to you, Ye have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give to us.\n",
      "Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said to thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.\n",

      "And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:\n",
      "And they turned and ascended the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and explored it.\n",
      "And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.\n",
      "Notwithstanding, ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:\n",
      "And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth from the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.\n",
      "Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.\n",
      "Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.\n",
      "The LORD your God who goeth before you; he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;\n",
      "And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how the LORD thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.\n",
      "Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,\n",
      "Who went in the way before you, to search out for you a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.\n",
      "And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,\n",
      "Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,\n",
      "Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trod upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.\n",
      "Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.\n",
      "But Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither. Encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.\n",
      "Moreover, your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.\n",
      "But as for you, turn ye, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.\n",
      "Then ye answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to ascend the hill.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Say to them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.\n",
      "So I spoke to you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and presumptuously ascended the hill.\n",
      "And the Amorites, who dwelt on that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.\n",
      "And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear to you.\n",
      "So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that ye abode there.\n",
      "Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to me, saying,\n",
      "Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.\n",
      "And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: therefore take ye good heed to yourselves:\n",
      "Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot-breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.\n",
      "Ye shall buy food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.\n",
      "For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee: thou hast lacked nothing.\n",
      "And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.\n",
      "(The Emims dwelt in it in times past, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims;\n",
      "Who also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.\n",
      "The Horims also dwelt formerly in Seir, but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.)\n",
      "Now rise, said I, and pass over the brook Zered: and we went over the brook Zered.\n",
      "And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we passed the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.\n",
      "For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.\n",
      "So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,\n",
      "That the LORD spoke to me, saying,\n",
      "Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:\n",
      "And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.\n",
      "(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt in it in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;\n",
      "A people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:\n",
      "As he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day:\n",
      "And the Avims who dwelt in Hazerim even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, who came forth from Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)\n",
      "Arise ye, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.\n",
      "This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.\n",
      "And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,\n",
      "Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.\n",
      "Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;\n",
      "(As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.\n",
      "But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.\n",
      "Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.\n",
      "And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.\n",
      "And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones of every city, we left none to remain.\n",
      "Only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.\n",
      "From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all to us:\n",
      "Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor to any place of the river Jabbok, nor to the cities on the mountains, nor to whatever the LORD our God forbad us.\n",
      "Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.\n",
      "So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.\n",
      "And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.\n",
      "All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns a great number.\n",
      "And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.\n",
      "But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.\n",
      "And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon;\n",
      "(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)\n",
      "All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.\n",
      "For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.\n",
      "And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.\n",
      "And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.\n",
      "Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, to the borders of Geshuri, and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, to this day.\n",
      "And I gave Gilead to Machir.\n",
      "And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon:\n",
      "The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast of it, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt-sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.\n",
      "And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.\n",
      "But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have many cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;\n",
      "Until the LORD shall have given rest to your brethren, as well as to you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man to his possession which I have given you.\n",
      "And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thy eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to these two kings: so shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms whither thou passest.\n",
      "Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.\n",
      "And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,\n",
      "O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?\n",
      "I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.\n",
      "But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more to me of this matter.\n",
      "Ascend to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thy eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thy eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.\n",
      "But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.\n",
      "So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.\n",
      "Now therefore hearken, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.\n",
      "Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.\n",
      "Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.\n",
      "But ye who adhered to the LORD your God, are alive every one of you this day.\n",
      "Behold, I have taught you statutes, and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.\n",
      "Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.\n",
      "For what nation is there so great, which hath God so nigh to them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?\n",
      "And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?\n",
      "Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou shouldst forget the things which thy eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them to thy sons, and thy sons\\' sons:\n",
      "Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.\n",
      "And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.\n",
      "And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.\n",
      "And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.\n",
      "Take ye therefore good heed to yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire;\n",
      "Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make to you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,\n",
      "The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,\n",
      "The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:\n",
      "And lest thou shouldst lift up thy eyes to heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided to all nations under the whole heaven.\n",
      "But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, even from Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.\n",
      "Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not enter that good land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:\n",
      "But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.\n",
      "Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.\n",
      "For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.\n",
      "When thou shalt beget children, and children\\'s children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:\n",
      "I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from the land to which ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall be utterly destroyed.\n",
      "And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.\n",
      "And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men\\'s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.\n",
      "But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou shalt seek him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.\n",
      "When thou art in tribulation, and all these things have come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou shalt turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient to his voice;\n",
      "(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which he swore to them.\n",
      "For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?\n",
      "Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?\n",
      "Or hath God essayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an out-stretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?\n",
      "To thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none besides him.\n",
      "Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee; and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and thou heardst his words from the midst of the fire.\n",
      "And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out of Egypt in his sight with his mighty power.\n",
      "To drive out nations from before thee, greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.\n",
      "Know therefore this day, and consider it in thy heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.\n",
      "Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.\n",
      "Then Moses set apart three cities on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising;\n",
      "That the slayer might flee thither, who should kill his neighbor unawares, and when he had not hated him in times past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:\n",
      "Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.\n",
      "And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.\n",
      "These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came forth from Egypt,\n",
      "On the east side of Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they had come forth from Egypt:\n",
      "And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who were on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising;\n",
      "From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even to mount Sion, which is Hermon,\n",
      "And all the plain on the side of Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.\n",
      "And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.\n",
      "The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.\n",
      "The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.\n",
      "The LORD talked with you face to face on the mount, from the midst of the fire,\n",
      "(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up upon the mount;) saying,\n",
      "I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\n",
      "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\n",
      "Thou shalt not make for thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:\n",
      "Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,\n",
      "And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.\n",
      "Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n",
      "Keep the sabbath-day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.\n",
      "Six days thou shalt labor, and do all thy work:\n",
      "But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou.\n",
      "And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand and by an out-stretched arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath-day.\n",
      "Honor thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\n",
      "Thou shalt not kill.\n",
      "Neither shalt thou commit adultery.\n",
      "Neither shalt thou steal.\n",
      "Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.\n",
      "Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor\\'s wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor\\'s house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbor\\'s.\n",
      "These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly on the mount from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;\n",
      "And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.\n",
      "Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.\n",
      "For who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?\n",
      "Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say; and speak thou to us all that the LORD our God shall speak to thee; and we will hear it, and do it.\n",
      "And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoke to thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.\n",
      "O that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!\n",
      "Go, say to them, Return to your tents again.\n",
      "But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak to thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.\n",

      "And when thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?\n",
      "Then thou shalt say to thy son, We were Pharoah\\'s bond-men in Egypt: and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:\n",
      "And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and distressing, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:\n",
      "And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.\n",
      "And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.\n",
      "And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.\n",
      "When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perrizites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;\n",
      "And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:\n",
      "Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give to his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take to thy son.\n",
      "For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.\n",
      "But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.\n",
      "For thou art a holy people to the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people to himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.\n",
      "The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:\n",
      "But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn to your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bond-men, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.\n",
      "Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations:\n",
      "And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.\n",
      "Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.\n",
      "Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God will keep to thee the covenant and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers:\n",
      "And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless thy children, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he swore to thy fathers to give thee.\n",
      "Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.\n",
      "And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt (which thou knowest) upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.\n",
      "And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver to thee; thy eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare to thee.\n",
      "If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations are more than I, how can I dispossess them?\n",
      "Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;\n",
      "The great temptations which thy eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the out-stretched arm, by which the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do to all the people of whom thou art afraid.\n",
      "Moreover, the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, shall be destroyed.\n",
      "Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.\n",
      "And the LORD thy God will drive out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.\n",
      "But the LORD thy God shall deliver them to thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they are destroyed.\n",
      "And he shall deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou shalt have destroyed them.\n",
      "The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to thee, lest thou shouldst be snared in it: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.\n",
      "Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thy house, lest thou shouldst be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.\n",
      "All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers.\n",
      "And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments, or not.\n",
      "And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.\n",
      "Thy raiment hath not become old upon thee, neither hath thy foot swelled these forty years.\n",
      "Thou shalt also consider in thy heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.\n",
      "Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.\n",
      "For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;\n",
      "A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive-oil, and honey;\n",
      "A land in which thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.\n",
      "When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.\n",
      "Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:\n",
      "Lest when thou hast eaten, and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt in them;\n",
      "And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold are increased, and all that thou hast is increased;\n",
      "Then thy heart shall be lifted up, and thou shalt forget the LORD thy God (who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;)\n",
      "Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, in which were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drouth, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;\n",
      "Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end.\n",
      "And thou shalt say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.\n",
      "But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to thy fathers, as it is this day.\n",
      "And it shall be, if thou shalt at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.\n",
      "As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient to the voice of the LORD your God.\n",
      "Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,\n",
      "A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard it said, Who can stand before the children of Anak!\n",
      "Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he who goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said to thee.\n",
      "Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.\n",
      "Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations, the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore to thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n",
      "Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiff-necked people.\n",
      "Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart from the land of Egypt, until ye came to this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.\n",
      "Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.\n",
      "When I ascended the mount, to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither ate bread, nor drank water:\n",
      "And the LORD delivered to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words which the LORD spoke with you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Arise, go down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.\n",
      "Furthermore, the LORD spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:\n",
      "Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.\n",
      "So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.\n",
      "And I looked, and behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you.\n",
      "And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.\n",
      "And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I neither ate bread, nor drank water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.\n",
      "(For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you.) But the LORD hearkened to me at that time also.\n",
      "And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.\n",
      "And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended from the mount.\n",
      "And at Taberah, and at Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.\n",
      "Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.\n",
      "Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.\n",
      "Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.\n",
      "I prayed therefore to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.\n",
      "Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:\n",
      "Lest the land from which thou hast brought us should say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.\n",
      "Yet they are thy people and thy inheritance which thou hast brought out by thy mighty power and by thy out-stretched arm.\n",
      "At that time the LORD said to me, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me upon the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.\n",
      "And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them in the ark.\n",
      "And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like the first, and ascended the mount, having the two tables in my hand.\n",
      "And he wrote on the tables according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.\n",
      "And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me.\n",
      "And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jakan to Mosira: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest\\'s office in his stead.\n",
      "From thence they journeyed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.\n",
      "At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.\n",
      "Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.\n",
      "And I stayed in the mount, according to the first-time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened to me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.\n",
      "And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,\n",
      "To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?\n",
      "Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belongeth to the LORD thy God, the earth also, with all that it contains.\n",
      "Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.\n",
      "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.\n",
      "For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:\n",
      "He executeth the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.\n",
      "Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.\n",
      "He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thy eyes have seen.\n",
      "Thy fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.\n",
      "Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, always.\n",
      "And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his out-stretched arm,\n",
      "And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;\n",
      "And what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them to this day;\n",
      "And what he did to you in the wilderness, until ye came to this place;\n",
      "And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:\n",
      "But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.\n",
      "Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;\n",
      "And that ye may prolong your days in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.\n",
      "For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou didst sow thy seed, and water it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:\n",
      "But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:\n",
      "A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,\n",
      "That I will give you the rain of your land in its due season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine and thy oil.\n",
      "And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.\n",
      "Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;\n",
      "And then the LORD\\'S wrath shall be kindled against you, and he shall shut up the heaven, that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.\n",
      "Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.\n",
      "And ye shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\n",
      "And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates:\n",
      "That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.\n",
      "For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave to him;\n",
      "Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.\n",
      "Every place on which the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your limit be.\n",
      "There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you, and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said to you.\n",
      "Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:\n",
      "A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you this day;\n",
      "And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods which ye have not known.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in to the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.\n",
      "Are they not on the other side of Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the Canaanites, who dwell in the plain over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?\n",
      "For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell in it.\n",
      "And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.\n",
      "These are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.\n",
      "Ye shall utterly destroy all the places in which the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:\n",
      "And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.\n",
      "Ye shall not do so to the LORD your God.\n",
      "But the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:\n",
      "And thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave-offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will-offerings, and the firstlings of your herds, and of your flocks:\n",
      "And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand to, ye and your households, in which the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.\n",
      "Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes.\n",
      "For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the LORD your God giveth you.\n",
      "But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies on every side, so that ye dwell in safety:\n",
      "Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow to the LORD:\n",
      "And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.\n",
      "Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest:\n",
      "But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.\n",
      "Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatever thy soul desireth, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat of it as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.\n",
      "Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.\n",
      "Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy free-will-offerings, or heave-offering of thy hand:\n",
      "But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands to.\n",
      "Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.\n",
      "When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatever thy soul desireth.\n",
      "If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there, shall be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatever thy soul desireth.\n",
      "Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.\n",
      "Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.\n",
      "Thou shalt not eat it: thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.\n",
      "Thou shalt not eat it; that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.\n",
      "Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go to the place which the LORD shall choose:\n",
      "And thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.\n",
      "Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.\n",
      "When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;\n",
      "Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.\n",
      "Thou shalt not do so to the LORD thy God; for every abomination to the LORD which he hateth have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.\n",
      "Whatever thing I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add to it, nor diminish from it.\n",
      "If there shall arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and give thee a sign or a wonder.\n",
      "And the sign or the wonder shall come to pass, of which he spoke to thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;\n",
      "Thou shalt not hearken to the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\n",
      "Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave to him.\n",
      "And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou remove the evil from the midst of thee.\n",
      "If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, who is as thy own soul, shall entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;\n",

      "If thou shalt hear, in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,\n",
      "Certain men, the children of Belial, have gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;\n",
      "Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and behold, if it is truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;\n",
      "Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is in it, and its cattle, with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of its street, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil of it every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be a heap forever; it shalt not be built again.\n",
      "And there shall cleave naught of the cursed thing to thy hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn to thy fathers;\n",
      "When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.\n",
      "Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.\n",

      "Nevertheless, these ye shall not eat, of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean to you.\n",
      "And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, is unclean to you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.\n",
      "These ye shall eat, of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:\n",

      "Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it to the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it to an alien: for thou art a holy people to the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother\\'s milk.\n",
      "Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.\n",
      "And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thy oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.\n",

      "At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.\n",
      "And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth aught to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD\\'S release.\n",
      "Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thy hand shall release:\n",

      "Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thy eye shall be evil against thy poor brother, and thou shalt give him naught; and he shall cry to the LORD against thee, and it shall be sin to thee.\n",
      "Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest to him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thy hand to.\n",
      "For the poor shall never cease from the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thy hand wide to thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.\n",
      "And if thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, shall be sold to thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.\n",

      "And if there is any blemish in it, as if it is lame, or blind, or hath any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it to the LORD thy God.\n",
      "Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.\n",
      "Only thou shalt not eat its blood; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.\n",
      "Observe the month Abib, and keep the passover to the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth from Egypt by night.\n",
      "Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover to the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.\n",

      "Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt do no work.\n",
      "Seven weeks shalt thou number to thee: begin to number the seven weeks from the time when thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.\n",
      "And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks to the LORD thy God with a tribute of a free-will-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give to the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:\n",
      "And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.\n",

      "Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.\n",
      "Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.\n",
      "That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\n",
      "Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make for thee.\n",
      "Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God hateth.\n",

      "At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.\n",
      "The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt remove the evil from among you.\n",
      "If there shall arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and go up to the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;\n",
      "And thou shalt come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment:\n",
      "And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall show thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:\n",
      "According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall show thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.\n",
      "And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken to the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or to the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt remove the evil from Israel.\n",

      "The first-fruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thy oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.\n",
      "For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.\n",
      "And if a Levite shall come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind to the place which the LORD shall choose;\n",

      "They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.\n",
      "When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.\n",
      "There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,\n",
      "Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.\n",

      "Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.\n",
      "For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened to observers of times, and to diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.\n",
      "The LORD thy God will raise up to thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like to me; to him ye shall hearken.\n",
      "According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I may not die.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, They have well spoken of that which they have spoken.\n",
      "I will raise up to them a prophet from among their brethren, like thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that whoever will not hearken to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.\n",
      "But the prophet, who shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.\n",
      "And if thou shalt say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?\n",
      "When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing doth not follow, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.\n",
      "When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;\n",
      "Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.\n",
      "Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the limits of thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.\n",
      "And this is the case of the slayer, who shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoever killeth his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;\n",
      "As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand maketh a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and falleth upon his neighbor, that he dieth: he shall flee to one of these cities, and live:\n",
      "Lest the avenger of blood shall pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.\n",
      "Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.\n",
      "And if the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy limits, as he hath sworn to thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give to thy fathers;\n",
      "If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:\n",
      "That innocent blood may not be shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.\n",
      "But if any man shall hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally, that he dieth, and he shall flee into one of these cities:\n",
      "Then the elders of his city shall send and bring him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.\n",
      "Thy eye shall not pity him, but thou shall remove the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may be well with thee.\n",
      "Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor\\'s landmark, which they of old time have set in thy inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.\n",
      "One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.\n",
      "If a false witness shall rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;\n",
      "Then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the LORD, before the priests, and the judges, who shall be in those days;\n",
      "And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and behold, if the witness is a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;\n",

      "And it shall be when ye are come nigh to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,\n",
      "And shall say to them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day to battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;\n",
      "For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.\n",
      "And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he should die in the battle, and another man should dedicate it.\n",
      "And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return to his house, lest he should die in the battle, and another man should eat of it.\n",
      "And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return to his house, lest he should die in battle, and another man should take her.\n",
      "And the officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return to his house, lest his brethren\\'s heart should faint as well as his heart.\n",
      "And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.\n",
      "When thou comest nigh to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.\n",
      "And it shall be, if it shall make thee answer of peace, and open to thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein, shall be tributaries to thee, and they shall serve thee.\n",
      "And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:\n",
      "And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thy hands, thou shalt smite every male of it with the edge of the sword:\n",
      "But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil of it, shalt thou take to thyself: and thou shalt eat the spoil of thy enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.\n",
      "Thus shalt thou do to all the cities which are very distant from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.\n",
      "But of the cities of these people which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:\n",
      "But thou shalt utterly destroy them, namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:\n",
      "That they may not teach you to do after all their abominations which they have done to their gods; so would ye sin against the LORD your God.\n",
      "When thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees of it by forcing an ax against them; for thou mayest eat of them: and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man\\'s life) to employ them in the siege:\n",
      "Only the trees which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it shall be subdued.\n",

      "And it shall be that the city which is next to the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;\n",
      "And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a rough valley, which is neither tilled nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer\\'s neck there in the valley;\n",
      "And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near (for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of the LORD) and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried;\n",

      "Because thou didst not serve the LORD thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things:\n",
      "Therefore shalt thou serve thy enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he hath destroyed thee.\n",
      "The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth, a nation whose language thou shalt not understand:\n",

      "But if thy heart shall turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;\n",
      "I denounce to you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.\n",
      "I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:\n",
      "That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days) that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD swore to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.\n",
      "And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.\n",

      "And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.\n",
      "Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee, he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.\n",

      "And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.\n",
      "And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.\n",
      "And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,\n",
      "When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.\n",
      "Convene the people, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:\n",
      "And that their children who have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud; and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people will rise up, and commit idolatry with the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.\n",
      "Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, Have not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?\n",
      "And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned to other gods.\n",
      "Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.\n",
      "For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness: for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they form, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.\n",
      "Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.\n",
      "And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with thee.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,\n",
      "That Moses commanded the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,\n",
      "Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.\n",
      "For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?\n",
      "Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.\n",
      "For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.\n",
      "And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were ended.\n",
      "Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.\n",
      "My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:\n",
      "Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness to our God.\n",
      "He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity: just and right is he.\n",
      "They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.\n",
      "Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?\n",
      "Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.\n",
      "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.\n",
      "For the LORD\\'S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.\n",
      "He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.\n",
      "As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings;\n",
      "So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange God with him.\n",
      "He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;\n",
      "Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.\n",
      "But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou hast waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.\n",
      "They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations they provoked him to anger.\n",
      "They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods which they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.\n",
      "Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.\n",
      "And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.\n",
      "And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.\n",
      "They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.\n",
      "For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.\n",
      "I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend my arrows upon them.\n",
      "They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\n",
      "The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.\n",
      "I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;\n",
      "Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.\n",
      "For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.\n",
      "O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!\n",
      "How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?\n",
      "For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges:\n",
      "For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:\n",
      "Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.\n",
      "Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?\n",
      "To me belongeth vengeance, and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.\n",
      "For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent for his servants: when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.\n",
      "And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,\n",
      "Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.\n",
      "See now that I, even I am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.\n",
      "For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.\n",
      "If I shall whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.\n",
      "I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.\n",
      "Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.\n",
      "And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun.\n",
      "And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;\n",
      "And he said to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.\n",
      "For it is not a vain thing for you: because it is your life; and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses that same day, saying,\n",
      "Ascend this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan which I give to the children of Israel for a Possession:\n",
      "And die in the mount whither thou goest, and be gathered to thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:\n",
      "Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.\n",
      "Yet thou shalt see the land before thee, but thou shalt not go thither to the land which I give the children of Israel.\n",
      "And this is the with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death.\n",
      "And he said, the LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.\n",
      "Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.\n",
      "Moses commanded us a law; even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.\n",
      "And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were assembled.\n",

      "And Moses went up from the plains of Moab, upon the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho: and the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,\n",

      "And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.\n",
      "Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses\\'s minister, saying,\n",
      "Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.\n",
      "Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given to you, as I said to Moses.\n",
      "From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea towards the setting of the sun, shall be your border.\n",
      "There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.\n",
      "Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.\n",
      "Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.\n",
      "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.\n",
      "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.\n",
      "Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,\n",
      "Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you provisions; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.\n",
      "And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,\n",
      "Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.\n",
      "Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;\n",
      "Until the LORD shall have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD\\'S servant gave you on this side of Jordan towards the sun-rising.\n",
      "And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us, we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.\n",
      "According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.\n",
      "Every one that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken to thy words in all that thou commandest him, shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go, view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into the house of a harlot, named Rahab, and lodged there.\n",
      "And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel, to search out the country.\n",
      "And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have entered into thy house: for they have come to search out all the country.\n",
      "And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not whence they were:\n",
      "And it came to pass about the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went, I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.\n",
      "But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.\n",
      "And the men pursued them the way to Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.\n",
      "And before they had lain down, she came up to them upon the roof;\n",
      "And she said to the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.\n",
      "For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.\n",
      "And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness to my father\\'s house, and give me a true token:\n",
      "And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.\n",
      "And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.\n",
      "Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.\n",
      "And she said to them, Depart to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned: and afterward ye may go your way.\n",
      "And the men said to her, We will be blameless of this thy oath which thou hast made us swear.\n",
      "Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which thou didst let us down: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father\\'s household home to thee.\n",
      "And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.\n",
      "And if thou shalt utter this our business, then we will be quit of thy oath which thou hast made us to swear.\n",
      "And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.\n",
      "And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers had returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.\n",
      "So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:\n",
      "And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.\n",
      "And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.\n",
      "And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;\n",
      "And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.\n",
      "Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to-morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.\n",
      "And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.\n",
      "And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye have come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.\n",
      "And Joshua said, By this ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.\n",
      "Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.\n",
      "Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in a heap.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;\n",
      "And as they that bore the ark had come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)\n",
      "That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan; and those that came down towards the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.\n",
      "And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had passed quite over Jordan.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,\n",
      "Take you twelve men from the people, from every tribe a man,\n",
      "And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, from the place where the priests\\' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night.\n",
      "Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, of every tribe a man:\n",
      "And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:\n",
      "That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?\n",
      "Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for ever.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of Jordan, as the the LORD commanded Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.\n",
      "And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.\n",
      "For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests in the presence of the people.\n",
      "And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses directed them:\n",
      "About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.\n",
      "On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,\n",
      "Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.\n",
      "Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests\\' feet were lifted up upon the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as they did before.\n",
      "And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.\n",
      "And those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.\n",
      "And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?\n",
      "Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.\n",
      "For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had gone over:\n",
      "That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we had passed over, that their heart melted; neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.\n",
      "At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.\n",
      "And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.\n",
      "And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.\n",
      "Now all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth from Egypt, them they had not circumcised.\n",
      "For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war who came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.\n",
      "And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.\n",
      "And it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you: Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.\n",
      "And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.\n",
      "And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the same day.\n",
      "And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.\n",
      "And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?\n",
      "And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What saith my lord to his servant?\n",
      "And the captain of the LORD\\'S host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou standest is holy: and Joshua did so.\n",
      "Now Jericho was closely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and its king, and the mighty men of valor.\n",
      "And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round the city once: thus shalt thou do six days.\n",
      "And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams\\' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram\\'s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout: and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend every man straight before him.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams\\' horns before the ark of the LORD.\n",
      "And he said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams\\' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.\n",
      "And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear-guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.\n",
      "And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed from your mouth, until the day I bid you shout, then shall ye shout.\n",
      "So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.\n",
      "And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.\n",
      "And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams\\' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear-guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.\n",
      "And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.\n",
      "And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are in it, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.\n",
      "And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.\n",
      "But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated to the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.\n",
      "So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.\n",
      "And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "But Joshua had said to the two men that spied out the country, Go into the harlot\\'s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore to her.\n",
      "And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.\n",
      "And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father\\'s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even to this day; because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.\n",
      "And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay its foundation in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.\n",
      "So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.\n",
      "But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.\n",
      "And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they are but few.\n",
      "So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.\n",
      "And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.\n",
      "And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.\n",
      "And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? O that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of Jordan.\n",
      "O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turn their backs before their enemies!\n",
      "For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will environ us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Arise; Why liest thou thus upon thy face?\n",
      "Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own goods.\n",
      "Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.\n",
      "Rise, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.\n",
      "In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to their families: and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.\n",
      "And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.\n",
      "So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:\n",
      "And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:\n",
      "And he brought his household man by man; and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.\n",
      "And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what thou hast done, hide it not from me.\n",
      "And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.\n",
      "When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them, and behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.\n",
      "So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.\n",
      "And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.\n",
      "And Joshua said, why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.\n",
      "And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger: wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of Achor to this day.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:\n",
      "And thou shalt do to Ai and her king, as thou didst to Jericho and her king: only its spoil, and its cattle, shall ye take for a prey to yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.\n",
      "So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.\n",
      "And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:\n",
      "And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach to the city: and it shall come to pass when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,\n",
      "(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.\n",
      "Then ye shall rise from the ambush and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand,\n",
      "And it shall be when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.\n",
      "Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.\n",
      "And Joshua rose early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.\n",
      "And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.\n",
      "And he took about five thousand men; and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.\n",
      "And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.\n",
      "And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain: but he knew not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.\n",
      "And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.\n",
      "And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue them: and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.\n",
      "And there was not a man left in Ai, or Beth-el that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand towards Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand towards the city.\n",
      "And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted, and set the city on fire.\n",
      "And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.\n",
      "And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again and slew the men of Ai.\n",
      "And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.\n",
      "And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.\n",
      "And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they chased them, and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.\n",
      "For Joshua drew not his hand back with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.\n",
      "Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.\n",
      "And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation to this day.\n",
      "And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise upon it a great heap of stones, that remaineth to this day.\n",
      "Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,\n",
      "As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lifted up any iron: and they offered upon it burnt-offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace-offerings.\n",
      "And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark, and on that side, before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.\n",
      "And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.\n",
      "There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all the kings who were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite heard these things,\n",
      "That they assembled themselves, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.\n",
      "And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,\n",
      "They did work craftily, and went and made as if they had been embassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;\n",
      "And old shoes and patched upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.\n",
      "And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.\n",
      "And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, It may be ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?\n",
      "And they said to Joshua, we are thy servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are ye? and whence come ye?\n",
      "And they said to him, From a very far country thy servants have come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,\n",
      "And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.\n",
      "Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us:\n",
      "This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is moldy:\n",
      "And these bottles of wine which we filled, were new, and behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.\n",
      "And the men took of their provisions, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.\n",
      "And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.\n",
      "And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.\n",
      "But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.\n",
      "This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them.\n",
      "And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood, and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.\n",
      "And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?\n",
      "Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bond-men, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.\n",
      "And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were greatly afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.\n",
      "And now, behold, we are in thy hand: do as it seemeth good and right to thee to do to us,\n",
      "And so did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.\n",
      "And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose.\n",
      "Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;\n",
      "That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men of it were mighty.\n",
      "Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,\n",
      "Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.\n",
      "Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, assembled themselves, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.\n",
      "And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains, are assembled against us.\n",
      "So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.\n",
      "Joshua therefore came to them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.\n",
      "And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.\n",
      "And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel, and were in the descent to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them to Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.\n",
      "Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.\n",
      "And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.\n",
      "And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened to the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.\n",
      "But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.\n",
      "And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.\n",
      "And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:\n",
      "And stay you not, but pursue your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest who remained of them entered into fortified cities.\n",
      "And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.\n",
      "Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings to me out of the cave.\n",
      "And they did so, and brought those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.\n",
      "And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.\n",
      "And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the time of the setting of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had been hid, and laid great stones upon the cave\\'s mouth, which remain until this very day.\n",
      "And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king of it he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were in it; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.\n",
      "Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:\n",
      "And the LORD delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it; he let none remain in it; but did to the king of it as he did to the king of Jericho.\n",
      "And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:\n",
      "And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.\n",
      "Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.\n",
      "And from Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:\n",
      "And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.\n",
      "And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it:\n",
      "And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls that were in them; he left none remaining (according to all that he had done to Eglon) but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were in it.\n",
      "And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:\n",
      "And he took it, and its king, and all its cities, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were in them; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.\n",
      "So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.\n",
      "And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.\n",
      "And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time; because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp in Gilgal.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king Achshaph,\n",
      "And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Cinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,\n",
      "And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.\n",
      "And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, many people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very numerous.\n",
      "And when all these kings were met together, they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to-morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.\n",
      "So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and they fell upon them.\n",
      "And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left to them none remaining.\n",
      "And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.\n",
      "And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote its king with the sword: for Hazor before-time was the head of all those kingdoms.\n",
      "And they smote all the souls that were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.\n",
      "And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, Joshua took, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.\n",
      "But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.\n",
      "And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey to themselves: but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.\n",
      "As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua: he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;\n",
      "Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even to Baal-gad, in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.\n",
      "Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.\n",
      "There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.\n",
      "For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And at that time came Joshua and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.\n",
      "There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.\n",
      "So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.\n",
      "Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side of Jordan towards the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon, to mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:\n",
      "Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;\n",
      "And from the plain to the sea of Cinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah:\n",
      "And the coast of Og king of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,\n",
      "And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites, and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.\n",
      "Them did Moses the servant of the LORD, and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.\n",
      "And these are the kings of the country whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side of Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon, even to the mount Halak that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;\n",
      "In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:\n",
      "The king of Jericho one; the king of Ai, which is beside Beth-el, one;\n",
      "The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;\n",
      "The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;\n",
      "The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;\n",
      "The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;\n",
      "The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;\n",
      "The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;\n",
      "The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth-el, one;\n",
      "The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;\n",
      "The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;\n",
      "The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;\n",
      "The king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;\n",
      "The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;\n",
      "The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;\n",
      "The king of Dor in the border of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;\n",

      "There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.\n",
      "There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.\n",

      "And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of Jordan;\n",
      "Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh\\'s sons had the land of Gilead.\n",
      "And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.\n",
      "Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;\n",

      "Yet the children of Manasseh could not expel the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\n",
      "Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel had become strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly expel them.\n",
      "And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath hitherto blessed me?\n",
      "And Joshua answered them, If thou art a great people, then go up to the wood, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee.\n",
      "And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.\n",
      "And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:\n",
      "But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the limits of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they are strong.\n",
      "And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there: and the land was subdued before them.\n",
      "And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?\n",
      "Select from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them, and they shall come again to me.\n",
      "And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their borders on the north.\n",
      "Ye shall therefore describe the land in seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.\n",
      "But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.\n",
      "And the men arose, and departed: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go, and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.\n",
      "And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven parts in a book, and came again, to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.\n",
      "And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.\n",
      "And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.\n",
      "And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the limits of it were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.\n",
      "And the border went over from thence towards Luz, to the side of Luz (which is Beth-el) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Beth-horon.\n",
      "And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the limits of it were at Kirjath-baal (which is Kirjath-jearim) a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter.\n",
      "And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjah-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:\n",
      "And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,\n",
      "And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth towards Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,\n",
      "And passed along towards the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to Arabah:\n",
      "And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the limits of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan. This was the south border.\n",
      "And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the limits of it round about, according to their families.\n",

      "And turneth towards the sun-rising to Beth-dagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthah-el towards the north side of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,\n",
      "And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Zidon;\n",
      "And then the border turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the border turneth to Hosah: and the limits of it are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:\n",
      "Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.\n",
      "This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.\n",
      "The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.\n",
      "And their border was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakum; and the limits thereof were at Jordan:\n",
      "And then the border turneth westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan towards the sun-rising.\n",
      "And the fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,\n",

      "This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.\n",
      "And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.\n",
      "And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,\n",

      "And Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon,\n",
      "And Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.\n",
      "And the border of the children of Dan, went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt in it, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.\n",
      "This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.\n",
      "When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their borders, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:\n",
      "According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt in it.\n",
      "These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.\n",
      "The LORD also spoke to Joshua, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint for you cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moses:\n",
      "That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and ignorantly, may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.\n",
      "And when he that doth flee to one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.\n",
      "And if the avenger of blood shall pursue him, then they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor ignorantly, and had not hated him before.\n",
      "And he shall dwell in that city, until he shall stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high-priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city from whence he fled.\n",
      "And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, (which is Hebron) in the mountain of Judah.\n",
      "And on the other side of Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.\n",
      "These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger sojourning among them, that whoever should kill any person unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.\n",
      "Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;\n",
      "And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for our cattle.\n",
      "And the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.\n",
      "And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.\n",
      "And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.\n",
      "And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.\n",
      "The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.\n",
      "And the children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name,\n",
      "Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot.\n",
      "And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak (which city is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah, with its suburbs round it.\n",
      "But the fields of the city, and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.\n",
      "Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest, Hebron with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with its suburbs,\n",
      "And Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,\n",
      "And Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,\n",
      "And Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, and Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,\n",
      "Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.\n",
      "All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.\n",
      "And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites who remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.\n",
      "For they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with its suburbs,\n",
      "And Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,\n",
      "Ajalon with its suburbs, Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.\n",
      "And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.\n",
      "All the cities were ten with their suburbs, for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.\n",
      "And to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half-tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer, and Beesh-terah with its suburbs; two cities.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with its suburbs, Dabareh with its suburbs,\n",
      "Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,\n",
      "Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.\n",
      "All the cities of the Gershonites, according to their families, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.\n",
      "And to the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs,\n",
      "Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahazah with its suburbs,\n",
      "Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with its suburbs,\n",
      "Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.\n",
      "So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.\n",
      "All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.\n",
      "These cities were every one with their suburbs around them. Thus were all these cities.\n",
      "And the LORD gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers: and they possessed it, and dwelt in it.\n",
      "And the LORD gave them rest on all sides, according to all that he swore to their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.\n",
      "There failed not aught of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.\n",
      "Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,\n",
      "And said to them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:\n",
      "Ye have not left your brethren these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.\n",
      "And now the LORD your God hath given rest to your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and go to your tents, and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of Jordan.\n",
      "But take diligent heed to perform the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul.\n",
      "So Joshua blessed them and sent them away; and they went to their tents.\n",
      "Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but to the other half of it gave Joshua among their brethren on this side of Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also to their tents, then he blessed them,\n",
      "And he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very many cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.\n",
      "And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, of which they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And when they came to the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to the sight.\n",
      "And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.\n",
      "And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,\n",
      "And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was a head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.\n",
      "And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,\n",
      "Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have built you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?\n",
      "Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,\n",
      "But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against the LORD, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.\n",
      "Not withstanding, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass ye over to the land of the possession of the LORD, in which the LORD\\'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God.\n",
      "Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.\n",
      "Then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel,\n",
      "The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it is in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)\n",
      "That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer on it burnt-offering, or meat-offering, or if to offer peace-offerings on it, let the LORD himself require it;\n",
      "And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children may speak to our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?\n",
      "For the LORD hath made Jordan a boundary between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD. So shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.\n",
      "Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:\n",
      "But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we may do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.\n",
      "Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they shall so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.\n",
      "Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt-offerings, for meat-offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.\n",
      "And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, and heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.\n",
      "And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.\n",
      "And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.\n",
      "And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.\n",
      "And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.\n",
      "And it came to pass, a long time after that the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on all sides, that Joshua became old and advanced in age.\n",
      "And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, I am old and advanced in age:\n",
      "And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.\n",
      "Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea westward.\n",
      "And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised to you.\n",
      "Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside from it to the right hand or to the left;\n",
      "That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them:\n",
      "But cleave to the LORD your God, as ye have done to this day.\n",
      "For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you to this day.\n",
      "One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.\n",
      "Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.\n",
      "Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and associate with them, and they with you:\n",
      "Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.\n",
      "And behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you: all are come to pass to you, and not one thing hath failed of it.\n",
      "Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he hath destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.\n",
      "When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given to you.\n",
      "And Joshua convened all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.\n",
      "And Joshua said to all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.\n",
      "And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.\n",
      "And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.\n",
      "I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.\n",
      "And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red sea.\n",
      "And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.\n",
      "And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of Jordan, and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.\n",
      "Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:\n",
      "But I would not hearken to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.\n",
      "And ye went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I delivered them into your hand.\n",
      "And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.\n",
      "And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive-yards which ye planted not do ye eat.\n",
      "Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.\n",
      "And if it seemeth evil to you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.\n",
      "And the people answered, and said, Be it far from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;\n",
      "For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us, and our fathers, out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:\n",
      "And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins.\n",
      "If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.\n",
      "And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.\n",
      "Now therefore put away (said he) the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.\n",
      "So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.\n",
      "And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us, it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest ye deny your God.\n",
      "So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died, being a hundred and ten years old.\n",
      "And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.\n",
      "And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and who had known all the works of the LORD that he had done for Israel.\n",
      "And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.\n",
      "And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.\n",
      "Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?\n",
      "And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.\n",
      "And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.\n",
      "And Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.\n",
      "And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.\n",
      "But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.\n",
      "And Adoni-bezek said, seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table; as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.\n",
      "(Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.)\n",
      "And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt on the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.\n",
      "And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.\n",
      "And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher:\n",
      "And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.\n",
      "And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb\\'s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What wilt thou?\n",
      "And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.\n",
      "And the children of the Kenite, Moses\\'s father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.\n",
      "And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.\n",
      "Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Askelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.\n",
      "And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.\n",
      "And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.\n",
      "And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the LORD was with them.\n",
      "And the house of Joseph sent to explore Beth-el. Now the name of the city before was Luz.\n",
      "And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.\n",
      "And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword: but they let go the man and all his family.\n",
      "And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz: which is its name to this day.\n",
      "Neither did Manasseh expel the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its towns, nor Tanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\n",
      "And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly expel them.\n",
      "Neither did Ephraim expel the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.\n",
      "Neither did Zebulun expel the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.\n",
      "Neither did Asher expel the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:\n",
      "But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not expel them.\n",
      "Neither did Naphtali expel the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.\n",
      "And the Amorites forced the children of Dan to the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:\n",
      "But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Ajalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.\n",
      "And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.\n",
      "And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to depart from Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.\n",
      "And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?\n",
      "Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.\n",
      "And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD.\n",
      "And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.\n",
      "And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.\n",
      "And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.\n",
      "And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:\n",
      "And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were around them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.\n",
      "And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.\n",
      "Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.\n",
      "Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.\n",
      "And yet they would not hearken to their judges, but they went astray after other gods, and bowed themselves to them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.\n",
      "And when the LORD raised up judges for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: (for the LORD repented because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and burdened them.)\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice;\n",
      "I also will not henceforth drive out from before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died:\n",
      "That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.\n",
      "Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out speedily, neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua.\n",
      "Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, (even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;\n",
      "Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it;)\n",
      "Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt on mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.\n",
      "And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:\n",
      "And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim, and the groves.\n",
      "Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.\n",
      "And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb\\'s younger brother.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.\n",
      "And the land had rest forty years: and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.\n",
      "And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm-trees.\n",
      "So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.\n",
      "But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjaminite, a man left-handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon king of Moab.\n",
      "But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.\n",
      "And he brought the present to Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.\n",
      "And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.\n",
      "But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.\n",
      "And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer-parlor, which he had for himself alone: and Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose from his seat.\n",
      "And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:\n",
      "And the haft also entered after the blade: and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.\n",
      "Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor upon him, and locked them.\n",
      "When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer-chamber.\n",
      "And they tarried till they were ashamed: and behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor, therefore they took a key and opened them: and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.\n",
      "And Ehud escaped while they tarried; and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.\n",
      "And it came to pass when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.\n",
      "And he said to them, Follow me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan towards Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.\n",
      "And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor: and there escaped not a man.\n",
      "So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel: and the land had rest eighty years.\n",
      "And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also delivered Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud was dead.\n",
      "And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan that reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.\n",
      "And the children of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.\n",
      "And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.\n",
      "And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go, and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali, and of the children of Zebulun?\n",
      "And I will draw to thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera the captain of Jabin\\'s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.\n",
      "And Barak said to her, if thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.\n",
      "And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honor; for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.\n",
      "And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.\n",
      "Now Heber the Kenite, who was of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.\n",
      "And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.\n",
      "And Sisera collected all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.\n",
      "And Deborah said to Barak, Arise, for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand: hath not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.\n",
      "And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.\n",
      "But Barak pursued the chariots, and the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.\n",
      "Howbeit, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.\n",
      "And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.\n",
      "And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.\n",
      "Again he said to her, stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.\n",
      "Then Jael, Heber\\'s wife, took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep, and weary. So he died.\n",
      "And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.\n",
      "So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.\n",
      "Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,\n",
      "Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.\n",
      "Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.\n",
      "The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through by-ways.\n",
      "The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.\n",
      "They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?\n",
      "My heart is towards the governors of Israel that offered themselves willingly among the people: Bless ye the LORD.\n",
      "Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.\n",
      "They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts towards the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.\n",
      "Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.\n",
      "Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.\n",
      "Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.\n",
      "And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah: even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.\n",
      "Why abodest thou among the sheep-folds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.\n",
      "Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea-shore, and abode in his breaches.\n",
      "Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives to death in the high places of the field.\n",
      "The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Tanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.\n",
      "They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.\n",
      "The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.\n",
      "Then were the horse\\'s hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.\n",
      "Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly its inhabitants; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.\n",
      "Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.\n",
      "He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.\n",
      "She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen\\'s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and struck through his temples.\n",
      "At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.\n",
      "The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?\n",
      "Her wise ladies answered her, yes, she returned answer to herself.\n",
      "Have they not found; have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needle-work, of divers colors of needle-work on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?\n",
      "So let all thy enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.\n",
      "And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.\n",
      "And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;\n",
      "And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou comest to Gaza; and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.\n",
      "For they came up with their cattle, and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.\n",
      "And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,\n",
      "That the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth from the house of bondage;\n",
      "And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;\n",
      "And I said to you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.\n",
      "And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon thrashed wheat by the wine-press, to hide it from the Midianites.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.\n",
      "And Gideon said to him, O my Lord, if the LORD is with us, why then hath all this befallen us? and where are all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.\n",
      "And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?\n",
      "And he said to him, O my Lord, by what means shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father\\'s house.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.\n",
      "And he said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me.\n",
      "Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou comest again.\n",
      "And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.\n",
      "And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.\n",
      "Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed from his sight.\n",
      "And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Peace be to thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.\n",
      "Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.\n",
      "And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take thy father\\'s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:\n",
      "And build an altar to the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.\n",
      "Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said to him: and so it was, because he feared his father\\'s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.\n",
      "And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.\n",
      "And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.\n",
      "Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.\n",
      "And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he is a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.\n",
      "Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.\n",
      "Then all the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east were assembled, and went over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.\n",
      "But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was called after him.\n",
      "And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was called after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.\n",
      "And Gideon said to God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,\n",
      "Behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the floor; and if the dew shall be on the fleece only, and it shall be dry upon all the earth besides, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.\n",
      "And it was so: for he rose early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl-full of water.\n",
      "And Gideon said to God, Let not thy anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: Let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.\n",
      "And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.\n",
      "Then Jerubbaal (who is Gideon) and all the people that were with him, rose early, and encamped beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand hath saved me.\n",
      "Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say to thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.\n",
      "So he brought down the people to the water: and the LORD said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.\n",
      "And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand: and let all the other people go every man to his place.\n",
      "So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent of all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. And the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.\n",
      "And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, go down to the host; for I have delivered it into thy hand.\n",
      "But if thou fearest to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:\n",
      "And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.\n",
      "And the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and all the children of the east, lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.\n",
      "And when Gideon had come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley-bread rolled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it that the tent lay along.\n",
      "And his fellow answered, and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.\n",
      "And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped, and returned to the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.\n",
      "And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man\\'s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.\n",
      "And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that as I do, so shall ye do.\n",
      "When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.\n",
      "So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.\n",
      "And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.\n",
      "And they stood every man in his place around the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.\n",
      "And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man\\'s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zereroth, and to the border of Abel-meholah, to Tabbath.\n",
      "And the men of Israel assembled out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites.\n",
      "And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim assembled, and took the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan.\n",
      "And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine-press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of Jordan.\n",
      "And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why hast thou treated us thus, that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? and they chid with him sharply.\n",
      "And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?\n",
      "God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then, when he had said that, their anger towards him abated.\n",
      "And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.\n",
      "And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me: for they are faint, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.\n",
      "And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy army?\n",
      "And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.\n",
      "And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.\n",
      "And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.\n",
      "Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.\n",
      "And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.\n",
      "And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.\n",
      "And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun had risen,\n",
      "And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described to him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, even seventy seven men.\n",
      "And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye upbraided me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men that are weary?\n",
      "And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness, and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.\n",
      "And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.\n",
      "Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.\n",
      "And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.\n",
      "And he said to Jether his first-born, Arise, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.\n",
      "Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels\\' necks.\n",
      "Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son\\'s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.\n",
      "And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.\n",
      "And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the ear-rings of his prey. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)\n",
      "And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and cast into it every man the ear-rings of his prey.\n",
      "And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested, was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; besides ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels\\' necks.\n",
      "And Gideon made of it an ephod, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither astray after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.\n",
      "Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they raised their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.\n",
      "And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.\n",
      "And Gideon had seventy sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.\n",
      "And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.\n",
      "And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.\n",
      "And it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went astray after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.\n",
      "And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side:\n",
      "Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.\n",
      "And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother\\'s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother\\'s father, saying,\n",
      "Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Which is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are seventy persons, should reign over you, or that one should reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.\n",
      "And his mother\\'s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.\n",
      "And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, who followed him.\n",
      "And he went to his father\\'s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, upon one stone; notwithstanding, yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.\n",
      "And all the men of Shechem assembled, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.\n",
      "And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice and cried, and said to them, Hearken to me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken to you.\n",
      "The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.\n",
      "But the olive-tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?\n",
      "And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over us.\n",
      "But the fig-tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?\n",
      "Then said the trees to the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.\n",
      "And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?\n",
      "Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.\n",
      "And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.\n",
      "Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands:\n",
      "(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you from the hand of Midian:\n",
      "And ye have risen up against my father\\'s house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother:)\n",
      "If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:\n",
      "But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.\n",
      "And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.\n",
      "When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,\n",
      "Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:\n",
      "That the cruelty done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem who aided him in the killing of his brethren.\n",
      "And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.\n",
      "And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.\n",
      "And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.\n",
      "And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him; is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?\n",
      "And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thy army, and come out.\n",
      "And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.\n",
      "And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed, and his brethren, are come to Shechem; and behold, they fortify the city against thee.\n",
      "Now therefore rise by night, thou, and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:\n",
      "And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun hath risen, thou shalt rise early, and attack the city: and behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.\n",
      "And Abimelech rose, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.\n",
      "And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.\n",
      "And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.\n",
      "And Gaal spoke again, and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.\n",
      "Then said Zebul to him, Where is now thy mouth, with which thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? are not these the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.\n",
      "And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.\n",
      "And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.\n",
      "And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.\n",
      "And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and behold, the people had come out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.\n",
      "And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.\n",
      "And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were in it, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.\n",
      "And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into a hold of the house of the god Berith.\n",
      "And it was told to Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were assembled.\n",
      "And Abimelech ascended mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.\n",
      "And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them: so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.\n",
      "Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.\n",
      "But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it after them, and ascended to the top of the tower.\n",
      "And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.\n",
      "And a certain woman cast a piece of of a millstone upon Abimelech\\'s head, and broke his skull.\n",
      "Then he called hastily to the young man his armor-bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.\n",
      "Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:\n",
      "And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.\n",
      "And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.\n",
      "And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.\n",
      "And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.\n",
      "And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.\n",
      "And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side of Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.\n",
      "Moreover, the children of Ammon passed over Jordan, to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was greatly distressed.\n",
      "And the children of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.\n",
      "And the LORD said to the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?\n",
      "The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.\n",
      "Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.\n",
      "Go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned: do thou to us whatever seemeth good to thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.\n",
      "And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.\n",
      "Then the children of Ammon were assembled, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves, and encamped in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\n",
      "Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.\n",
      "And Gilead\\'s wife bore him sons; and his wife\\'s sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father\\'s house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.\n",
      "Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and they went out with him.\n",
      "And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.\n",
      "And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah out of the land of Tob:\n",
      "And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and expel me from my father\\'s house; and why have ye come to me now when ye are in distress?\n",
      "And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\n",
      "And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?\n",
      "And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The LORD be a witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.\n",
      "Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou hast come against me to fight in my land?\n",
      "And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.\n",
      "And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon:\n",
      "And said to him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:\n",
      "But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;\n",
      "Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken to it. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab; but he would not consent. And Israel abode in Kadesh.\n",
      "Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.\n",
      "And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place.\n",
      "But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.\n",
      "And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.\n",
      "So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst thou possess it?\n",
      "Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.\n",
      "And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,\n",
      "While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that are along by the borders of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?\n",
      "Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.\n",
      "But, the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.\n",
      "Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,\n",
      "Then it shall be, that whatever cometh out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD\\'S, and I will offer it for a burnt-offering.\n",
      "So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.\n",
      "And he smote them from Aroer even till thou comest to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.\n",
      "And she said to him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thy enemies, even of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.\n",
      "And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,\n",
      "That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.\n",
      "And the men of Ephraim assembled, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee; we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.\n",
      "And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.\n",
      "And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: why then have ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?\n",
      "Then Jephthah collected all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.\n",
      "And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites who had escaped, said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, No;\n",
      "Then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan. And there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.\n",
      "And Jephthah judged Israel six years: then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.\n",
      "And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.\n",
      "And he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons: and he judged Israel seven years.\n",
      "Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth-lehem.\n",
      "And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.\n",
      "And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Ajalon in the country of Zebulun.\n",
      "And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.\n",
      "And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on seventy ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.\n",
      "And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.\n",
      "And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold, now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.\n",
      "Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine, nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:\n",
      "For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth: and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither did he tell me his name:\n",
      "But he said to me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth to the day of his death.\n",
      "Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God, whom thou didst send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.\n",
      "And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.\n",
      "And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man hath appeared to me, that came to me the other day.\n",
      "And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou the man that didst speak to the woman? And he said, I am.\n",
      "And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do to him?\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman, let her beware.\n",
      "She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.\n",
      "And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though thou shouldst detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou must offer it to the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.\n",
      "And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass, we may do thee honor?\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to him, why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?\n",
      "So Manoah took a kid, with a meat-offering, and offered it upon a rock to the LORD; and the angel did wonderously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.\n",
      "For it came to pass, when the flame ascended towards heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.\n",
      "But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.\n",
      "And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.\n",
      "But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would, as at this time, have told us such things as these.\n",
      "And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.\n",
      "And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.\n",
      "And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me for a wife.\n",
      "Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there not a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.\n",
      "But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.\n",
      "Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and behold, a young lion roared against him.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.\n",
      "And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.\n",
      "And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.\n",
      "And he took of it in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they ate: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.\n",
      "So his father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.\n",
      "And Samson said to them, I will now propose a riddle to you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:\n",
      "But if ye cannot declare it to me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said to him, propose thy riddle, that we may hear it.\n",
      "And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson\\'s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father\\'s house with fire: have ye called us to take what we possess? is it not so?\n",
      "And Samson\\'s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast proposed a riddle to the children of my people, and hast not told it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told it to my father nor to my mother, and shall I tell it to thee?\n",
      "And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she urged him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.\n",
      "And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments to them who expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father\\'s house.\n",
      "But Samson\\'s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.\n",
      "But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat-harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.\n",
      "And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.\n",
      "And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.\n",
      "And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took fire-brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a fire-brand in the midst between two tails.\n",
      "And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.\n",
      "Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.\n",
      "And Samson said to them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.\n",
      "And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter. And he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.\n",
      "Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.\n",
      "And the men of Judah said, Why have ye come up against us? And they answered, We have come to bind Samson, to do to him as he hath done to us.\n",
      "Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.\n",
      "And they said to him, We have come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.\n",
      "And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.\n",
      "And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his the hands.\n",
      "And he found a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men with it.\n",
      "And Samson said, With the jaw-bone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.\n",
      "And it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.\n",
      "And he was very thirsty, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die by thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?\n",
      "But God cleaved a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of it; and when he had drank, his spirit came again, and he revived. Wherefore he called the name of it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.\n",
      "And he judged Israel, in the days of the Philistines, twenty years.\n",
      "Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her.\n",
      "And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they encompassed him, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning when it is day we shall kill him.\n",
      "And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before Hebron.\n",
      "And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.\n",
      "And the lords of the Philistines came to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see in what his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.\n",
      "And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, in what thy great strength lieth, and with what thou mayest be bound to afflict thee.\n",
      "And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green withs, that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\n",
      "Then the lords of the Philistines brought to her seven green withs, which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.\n",
      "(Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.) And she said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.\n",
      "And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, with what thou mayest be bound.\n",
      "And he said to her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were used, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\n",
      "Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. (And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber.) And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.\n",
      "And Delilah said to Samson, hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me with what thou mayest be bound. And he said to her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.\n",
      "And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.\n",
      "And she said to him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? Thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me in what thy great strength lieth.\n",
      "And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed to death;\n",
      "That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazarite to God from my birth: if I be shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.\n",
      "And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath disclosed to me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought money in their hand.\n",
      "And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.\n",
      "And she said, the Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he knew not that the LORD had departed from him.\n",
      "But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.\n",
      "However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.\n",
      "Then the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.\n",
      "And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country; who slew many of us.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.\n",
      "And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars upon which the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.\n",
      "Now the house was full of men and women: and all the lords of the Philistines were there: and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.\n",
      "And Samson called to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.\n",
      "And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was supported, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.\n",
      "And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.\n",
      "Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.\n",
      "And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.\n",
      "And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst curse, and speak of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.\n",
      "And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to thee.\n",
      "Yet he restored the money to his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.\n",
      "And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\n",
      "And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.\n",
      "And the man departed out of the city from Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.\n",
      "And Micah said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.\n",
      "And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.\n",
      "And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.\n",
      "And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.\n",
      "Then said Micah, Now I know that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite for my priest.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day all their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their borders, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to explore the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.\n",
      "When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?\n",
      "And he said to them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.\n",
      "And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.\n",
      "And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way in which ye go.\n",
      "Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were in it, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.\n",
      "And they came to their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said to them, What say ye?\n",
      "And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.\n",
      "When ye go, ye shall come to a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is on the earth.\n",
      "And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.\n",
      "And they went up, and encamped in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim.\n",
      "And they passed thence to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.\n",
      "Then answered the five men that went to explore the country of Laish, and said to their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.\n",
      "And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and saluted him.\n",
      "And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.\n",
      "And the five men that went to explore the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.\n",
      "And these went into Micah\\'s house, and brought the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest to them, What do ye?\n",
      "And they said to him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: Is it better for thee to be a priest to the house of one man, or that thou shouldst be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?\n",
      "And the priest\\'s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.\n",
      "So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, and the cattle, and the furniture before them.\n",
      "And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah\\'s house were collected, and overtook the children of Dan.\n",
      "And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?\n",
      "And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye have gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say to me, What aileth thee?\n",
      "And the children of Dan said to him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows rush upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.\n",
      "And the children of Dan departed: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.\n",
      "And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.\n",
      "And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built a city and dwelt in it.\n",
      "And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: but the name of the city was Laish at the first.\n",
      "And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.\n",
      "And they set up for themselves Micah\\'s graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.\n",
      "And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite dwelling on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.\n",
      "And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father\\'s house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there four whole months.\n",
      "And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father\\'s house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.\n",
      "And his father-in-law, the damsel\\'s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they ate and drank, and lodged there.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he arose to depart: and the damsel\\'s father said to his son-in-law, Comfort thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward depart.\n",
      "And they sat down, and ate and drank both of them together: for the damsel\\'s father had said to the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.\n",
      "And when the man rose to depart, his father-in-law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.\n",
      "And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel\\'s father said, Comfort thy heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they ate both of them.\n",
      "And when the man arose to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel\\'s father, said to him, Behold now the day draweth towards evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day is coming to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.\n",
      "But the man would not tarry that night, but he arose and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.\n",
      "And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in to this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.\n",
      "And his master said to him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.\n",
      "And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.\n",
      "And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.\n",
      "And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.\n",
      "And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening, who was also of mount Ephraim; and he dwelt in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjaminites.\n",
      "And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a way-faring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?\n",
      "And he said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-Judah towards the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Beth-lehem-judah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me into his house.\n",
      "Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing:\n",
      "And the old man said, Peace be with thee; however, let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.\n",
      "So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet and ate and drank.\n",
      "Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house on all sides, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.\n",
      "And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.\n",
      "Behold, here is my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.\n",
      "But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.\n",
      "Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man\\'s house where her lord was, till it was light.\n",
      "And her lord rose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshhold.\n",
      "And he said to her, Rise, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her upon an ass, and the man rose, and went to his place.\n",
      "And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the borders of Israel.\n",
      "And it was so, that all that saw it, said, There hath been no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came from the land of Egypt to this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.\n",
      "Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.\n",
      "(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?\n",
      "And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.\n",
      "And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.\n",
      "And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.\n",
      "Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.\n",
      "And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house:\n",
      "But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up by lot against it;\n",
      "And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch provisions for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.\n",
      "So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.\n",
      "And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?\n",
      "Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and banish evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel:\n",
      "But the children of Benjamin assembled out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.\n",
      "Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; every one could sling stones to a hair-breadth, and not miss.\n",
      "And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.\n",
      "And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.\n",
      "And the children of Israel rose in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.\n",
      "And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin came forth from Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.\n",
      "And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.\n",
      "(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)\n",
      "And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.\n",
      "And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.\n",
      "Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD.\n",
      "And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,\n",
      "And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver them into thy hand.\n",
      "And Israel set liers in wait around Gibeah.\n",
      "And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city to the highways.\n",
      "And all the men of Israel rose out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.\n",
      "And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe: but they knew not that evil was near them.\n",
      "And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword.\n",
      "So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjaminites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.\n",
      "And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke to rise from the city.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.\n",
      "But when the flame began to rise from the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the flame of the city ascended to heaven.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil had come upon them.\n",
      "Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them who came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.\n",
      "Thus they inclosed the Benjaminites on all sides, and chased them, and trod them down with ease over against Gibeah towards the sun-rising.\n",
      "And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.\n",
      "And they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.\n",
      "So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.\n",
      "But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.\n",
      "And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.\n",
      "Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.\n",
      "And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept bitterly;\n",
      "And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "And the children of Israel repented for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.\n",
      "How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD, that we will not give them of our daughters for wives?\n",
      "And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? and behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.\n",
      "For the people were numbered, and behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.\n",
      "And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.\n",
      "And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.\n",
      "And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably to them.\n",
      "And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.\n",
      "And the people repented for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?\n",
      "And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that have escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.\n",
      "But, we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.\n",
      "Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.\n",
      "Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go, and lie in wait in the vineyards;\n",
      "And see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.\n",
      "And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be favorable to them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give to them at this time, that ye should be guilty.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and repaired the cities and dwelt in them.\n",
      "And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went from thence every man to his inheritance.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\n",
      "Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?\n",
      "And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.\n",
      "And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.\n",
      "And Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.\n",
      "And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.\n",
      "But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.\n",
      "And Adoni-bezek said, seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table; as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.\n",
      "(Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.)\n",
      "And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt on the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.\n",
      "And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.\n",
      "And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher:\n",
      "And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.\n",
      "And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb\\'s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What wilt thou?\n",
      "And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.\n",
      "And the children of the Kenite, Moses\\'s father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.\n",
      "And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.\n",
      "Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Askelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.\n",
      "And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.\n",
      "And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.\n",
      "And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the LORD was with them.\n",
      "And the house of Joseph sent to explore Beth-el. Now the name of the city before was Luz.\n",
      "And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.\n",
      "And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword: but they let go the man and all his family.\n",
      "And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz: which is its name to this day.\n",
      "Neither did Manasseh expel the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its towns, nor Tanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\n",
      "And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly expel them.\n",
      "Neither did Ephraim expel the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.\n",
      "Neither did Zebulun expel the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.\n",
      "Neither did Asher expel the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:\n",
      "But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not expel them.\n",
      "Neither did Naphtali expel the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.\n",
      "And the Amorites forced the children of Dan to the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:\n",
      "But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Ajalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.\n",
      "And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.\n",
      "And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to depart from Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.\n",
      "And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?\n",
      "Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.\n",
      "And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD.\n",
      "And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.\n",
      "And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.\n",
      "And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.\n",
      "And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:\n",
      "And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were around them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.\n",
      "And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.\n",
      "Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.\n",
      "Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.\n",
      "And yet they would not hearken to their judges, but they went astray after other gods, and bowed themselves to them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.\n",
      "And when the LORD raised up judges for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: (for the LORD repented because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and burdened them.)\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice;\n",
      "I also will not henceforth drive out from before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died:\n",
      "That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.\n",
      "Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out speedily, neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua.\n",
      "Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, (even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;\n",
      "Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it;)\n",
      "Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt on mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.\n",
      "And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:\n",
      "And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim, and the groves.\n",
      "Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.\n",
      "And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb\\'s younger brother.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.\n",
      "And the land had rest forty years: and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.\n",
      "And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm-trees.\n",
      "So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.\n",
      "But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjaminite, a man left-handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon king of Moab.\n",
      "But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.\n",
      "And he brought the present to Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.\n",
      "And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.\n",
      "But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.\n",
      "And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer-parlor, which he had for himself alone: and Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose from his seat.\n",
      "And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:\n",
      "And the haft also entered after the blade: and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.\n",
      "Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor upon him, and locked them.\n",
      "When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer-chamber.\n",
      "And they tarried till they were ashamed: and behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor, therefore they took a key and opened them: and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.\n",
      "And Ehud escaped while they tarried; and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.\n",
      "And it came to pass when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.\n",
      "And he said to them, Follow me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan towards Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.\n",
      "And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor: and there escaped not a man.\n",
      "So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel: and the land had rest eighty years.\n",
      "And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also delivered Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud was dead.\n",
      "And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan that reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.\n",
      "And the children of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.\n",
      "And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.\n",
      "And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go, and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali, and of the children of Zebulun?\n",
      "And I will draw to thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera the captain of Jabin\\'s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.\n",
      "And Barak said to her, if thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.\n",
      "And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honor; for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.\n",
      "And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.\n",
      "Now Heber the Kenite, who was of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.\n",
      "And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.\n",
      "And Sisera collected all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.\n",
      "And Deborah said to Barak, Arise, for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand: hath not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.\n",
      "And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.\n",
      "But Barak pursued the chariots, and the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.\n",
      "Howbeit, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.\n",
      "And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.\n",
      "And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.\n",
      "Again he said to her, stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.\n",
      "Then Jael, Heber\\'s wife, took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep, and weary. So he died.\n",
      "And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.\n",
      "So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.\n",
      "Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,\n",
      "Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.\n",
      "Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.\n",
      "The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through by-ways.\n",
      "The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.\n",
      "They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?\n",
      "My heart is towards the governors of Israel that offered themselves willingly among the people: Bless ye the LORD.\n",
      "Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.\n",
      "They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts towards the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.\n",
      "Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.\n",
      "Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.\n",
      "Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.\n",
      "And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah: even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.\n",
      "Why abodest thou among the sheep-folds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.\n",
      "Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea-shore, and abode in his breaches.\n",
      "Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives to death in the high places of the field.\n",
      "The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Tanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.\n",
      "They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.\n",
      "The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.\n",
      "Then were the horse\\'s hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.\n",
      "Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly its inhabitants; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.\n",
      "Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.\n",
      "He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.\n",
      "She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen\\'s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and struck through his temples.\n",
      "At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.\n",
      "The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?\n",
      "Her wise ladies answered her, yes, she returned answer to herself.\n",
      "Have they not found; have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needle-work, of divers colors of needle-work on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?\n",
      "So let all thy enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.\n",
      "And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.\n",
      "And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;\n",
      "And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou comest to Gaza; and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.\n",
      "For they came up with their cattle, and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.\n",
      "And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,\n",
      "That the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth from the house of bondage;\n",
      "And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;\n",
      "And I said to you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.\n",
      "And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon thrashed wheat by the wine-press, to hide it from the Midianites.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.\n",
      "And Gideon said to him, O my Lord, if the LORD is with us, why then hath all this befallen us? and where are all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.\n",
      "And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?\n",
      "And he said to him, O my Lord, by what means shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father\\'s house.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.\n",
      "And he said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me.\n",
      "Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou comest again.\n",
      "And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.\n",
      "And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.\n",
      "Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed from his sight.\n",
      "And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Peace be to thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.\n",
      "Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.\n",
      "And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take thy father\\'s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:\n",
      "And build an altar to the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.\n",
      "Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said to him: and so it was, because he feared his father\\'s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.\n",
      "And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.\n",
      "And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.\n",
      "Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.\n",
      "And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he is a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.\n",
      "Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.\n",
      "Then all the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east were assembled, and went over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.\n",
      "But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was called after him.\n",
      "And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was called after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.\n",
      "And Gideon said to God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,\n",
      "Behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the floor; and if the dew shall be on the fleece only, and it shall be dry upon all the earth besides, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.\n",
      "And it was so: for he rose early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl-full of water.\n",
      "And Gideon said to God, Let not thy anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: Let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.\n",
      "And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.\n",
      "Then Jerubbaal (who is Gideon) and all the people that were with him, rose early, and encamped beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand hath saved me.\n",
      "Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say to thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.\n",
      "So he brought down the people to the water: and the LORD said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.\n",
      "And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand: and let all the other people go every man to his place.\n",
      "So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent of all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. And the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.\n",
      "And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, go down to the host; for I have delivered it into thy hand.\n",
      "But if thou fearest to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:\n",
      "And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.\n",
      "And the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and all the children of the east, lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.\n",
      "And when Gideon had come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley-bread rolled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it that the tent lay along.\n",
      "And his fellow answered, and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.\n",
      "And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped, and returned to the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.\n",
      "And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man\\'s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.\n",
      "And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that as I do, so shall ye do.\n",
      "When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.\n",
      "So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.\n",
      "And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.\n",
      "And they stood every man in his place around the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.\n",
      "And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man\\'s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zereroth, and to the border of Abel-meholah, to Tabbath.\n",
      "And the men of Israel assembled out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites.\n",
      "And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim assembled, and took the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan.\n",
      "And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine-press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of Jordan.\n",
      "And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why hast thou treated us thus, that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? and they chid with him sharply.\n",
      "And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?\n",
      "God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then, when he had said that, their anger towards him abated.\n",
      "And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.\n",
      "And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me: for they are faint, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.\n",
      "And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy army?\n",
      "And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.\n",
      "And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.\n",
      "And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.\n",
      "Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.\n",
      "And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.\n",
      "And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.\n",
      "And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun had risen,\n",
      "And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described to him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, even seventy seven men.\n",
      "And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye upbraided me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men that are weary?\n",
      "And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness, and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.\n",
      "And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.\n",
      "Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.\n",
      "And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.\n",
      "And he said to Jether his first-born, Arise, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.\n",
      "Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels\\' necks.\n",
      "Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son\\'s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.\n",
      "And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.\n",
      "And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the ear-rings of his prey. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)\n",
      "And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and cast into it every man the ear-rings of his prey.\n",
      "And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested, was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; besides ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels\\' necks.\n",
      "And Gideon made of it an ephod, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither astray after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.\n",
      "Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they raised their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.\n",
      "And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.\n",
      "And Gideon had seventy sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.\n",
      "And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.\n",
      "And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.\n",
      "And it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went astray after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.\n",
      "And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side:\n",
      "Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.\n",
      "And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother\\'s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother\\'s father, saying,\n",
      "Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Which is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are seventy persons, should reign over you, or that one should reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.\n",
      "And his mother\\'s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.\n",
      "And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, who followed him.\n",
      "And he went to his father\\'s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, upon one stone; notwithstanding, yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.\n",
      "And all the men of Shechem assembled, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.\n",
      "And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice and cried, and said to them, Hearken to me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken to you.\n",
      "The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.\n",
      "But the olive-tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?\n",
      "And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over us.\n",
      "But the fig-tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?\n",
      "Then said the trees to the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.\n",
      "And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?\n",
      "Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.\n",
      "And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.\n",
      "Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands:\n",
      "(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you from the hand of Midian:\n",
      "And ye have risen up against my father\\'s house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother:)\n",
      "If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:\n",
      "But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.\n",
      "And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.\n",
      "When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,\n",
      "Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:\n",
      "That the cruelty done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem who aided him in the killing of his brethren.\n",
      "And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.\n",
      "And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.\n",
      "And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.\n",
      "And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him; is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?\n",
      "And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thy army, and come out.\n",
      "And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.\n",
      "And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed, and his brethren, are come to Shechem; and behold, they fortify the city against thee.\n",
      "Now therefore rise by night, thou, and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:\n",
      "And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun hath risen, thou shalt rise early, and attack the city: and behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.\n",
      "And Abimelech rose, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.\n",
      "And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.\n",
      "And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.\n",
      "And Gaal spoke again, and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.\n",
      "Then said Zebul to him, Where is now thy mouth, with which thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? are not these the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.\n",
      "And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.\n",
      "And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.\n",
      "And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.\n",
      "And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and behold, the people had come out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.\n",
      "And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.\n",
      "And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were in it, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.\n",
      "And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into a hold of the house of the god Berith.\n",
      "And it was told to Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were assembled.\n",
      "And Abimelech ascended mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.\n",
      "And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them: so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.\n",
      "Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.\n",
      "But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it after them, and ascended to the top of the tower.\n",
      "And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.\n",
      "And a certain woman cast a piece of of a millstone upon Abimelech\\'s head, and broke his skull.\n",
      "Then he called hastily to the young man his armor-bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.\n",
      "Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:\n",
      "And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.\n",
      "And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.\n",
      "And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.\n",
      "And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.\n",
      "And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.\n",
      "And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side of Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.\n",
      "Moreover, the children of Ammon passed over Jordan, to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was greatly distressed.\n",
      "And the children of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.\n",
      "And the LORD said to the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?\n",
      "The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.\n",
      "Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.\n",
      "Go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned: do thou to us whatever seemeth good to thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.\n",
      "And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.\n",
      "Then the children of Ammon were assembled, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves, and encamped in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\n",
      "Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.\n",
      "And Gilead\\'s wife bore him sons; and his wife\\'s sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father\\'s house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.\n",
      "Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and they went out with him.\n",
      "And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.\n",
      "And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah out of the land of Tob:\n",
      "And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and expel me from my father\\'s house; and why have ye come to me now when ye are in distress?\n",
      "And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\n",
      "And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?\n",
      "And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The LORD be a witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.\n",
      "Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou hast come against me to fight in my land?\n",
      "And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.\n",
      "And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon:\n",
      "And said to him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:\n",
      "But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;\n",
      "Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken to it. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab; but he would not consent. And Israel abode in Kadesh.\n",
      "Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.\n",
      "And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place.\n",
      "But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.\n",
      "And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.\n",
      "So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst thou possess it?\n",
      "Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.\n",
      "And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,\n",
      "While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that are along by the borders of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?\n",
      "Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.\n",
      "But, the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.\n",
      "Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,\n",
      "Then it shall be, that whatever cometh out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD\\'S, and I will offer it for a burnt-offering.\n",
      "So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.\n",
      "And he smote them from Aroer even till thou comest to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.\n",
      "And she said to him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thy enemies, even of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.\n",
      "And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,\n",
      "That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.\n",
      "And the men of Ephraim assembled, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee; we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.\n",
      "And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.\n",
      "And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: why then have ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?\n",
      "Then Jephthah collected all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.\n",
      "And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites who had escaped, said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, No;\n",
      "Then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan. And there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.\n",
      "And Jephthah judged Israel six years: then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.\n",
      "And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.\n",
      "And he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons: and he judged Israel seven years.\n",
      "Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth-lehem.\n",
      "And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.\n",
      "And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Ajalon in the country of Zebulun.\n",
      "And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.\n",
      "And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on seventy ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.\n",
      "And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.\n",
      "And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold, now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.\n",
      "Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine, nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:\n",
      "For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth: and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither did he tell me his name:\n",
      "But he said to me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth to the day of his death.\n",
      "Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God, whom thou didst send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.\n",
      "And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.\n",
      "And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man hath appeared to me, that came to me the other day.\n",
      "And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou the man that didst speak to the woman? And he said, I am.\n",
      "And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do to him?\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman, let her beware.\n",
      "She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.\n",
      "And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though thou shouldst detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou must offer it to the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.\n",
      "And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass, we may do thee honor?\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to him, why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?\n",
      "So Manoah took a kid, with a meat-offering, and offered it upon a rock to the LORD; and the angel did wonderously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.\n",
      "For it came to pass, when the flame ascended towards heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.\n",
      "But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.\n",
      "And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.\n",
      "But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would, as at this time, have told us such things as these.\n",
      "And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.\n",
      "And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.\n",
      "And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me for a wife.\n",
      "Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there not a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.\n",
      "But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.\n",
      "Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and behold, a young lion roared against him.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.\n",
      "And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.\n",
      "And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.\n",
      "And he took of it in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they ate: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.\n",
      "So his father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.\n",
      "And Samson said to them, I will now propose a riddle to you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:\n",
      "But if ye cannot declare it to me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said to him, propose thy riddle, that we may hear it.\n",
      "And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson\\'s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father\\'s house with fire: have ye called us to take what we possess? is it not so?\n",
      "And Samson\\'s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast proposed a riddle to the children of my people, and hast not told it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told it to my father nor to my mother, and shall I tell it to thee?\n",
      "And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she urged him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.\n",
      "And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments to them who expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father\\'s house.\n",
      "But Samson\\'s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.\n",
      "But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat-harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.\n",
      "And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.\n",
      "And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.\n",
      "And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took fire-brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a fire-brand in the midst between two tails.\n",
      "And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.\n",
      "Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.\n",
      "And Samson said to them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.\n",
      "And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter. And he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.\n",
      "Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.\n",
      "And the men of Judah said, Why have ye come up against us? And they answered, We have come to bind Samson, to do to him as he hath done to us.\n",
      "Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.\n",
      "And they said to him, We have come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.\n",
      "And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.\n",
      "And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his the hands.\n",
      "And he found a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men with it.\n",
      "And Samson said, With the jaw-bone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.\n",
      "And it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.\n",
      "And he was very thirsty, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die by thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?\n",
      "But God cleaved a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of it; and when he had drank, his spirit came again, and he revived. Wherefore he called the name of it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.\n",
      "And he judged Israel, in the days of the Philistines, twenty years.\n",
      "Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her.\n",
      "And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they encompassed him, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning when it is day we shall kill him.\n",
      "And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before Hebron.\n",
      "And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.\n",
      "And the lords of the Philistines came to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see in what his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.\n",
      "And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, in what thy great strength lieth, and with what thou mayest be bound to afflict thee.\n",
      "And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green withs, that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\n",
      "Then the lords of the Philistines brought to her seven green withs, which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.\n",
      "(Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.) And she said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.\n",
      "And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, with what thou mayest be bound.\n",
      "And he said to her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were used, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\n",
      "Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. (And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber.) And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.\n",
      "And Delilah said to Samson, hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me with what thou mayest be bound. And he said to her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.\n",
      "And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.\n",
      "And she said to him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? Thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me in what thy great strength lieth.\n",
      "And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed to death;\n",
      "That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazarite to God from my birth: if I be shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.\n",
      "And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath disclosed to me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought money in their hand.\n",
      "And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.\n",
      "And she said, the Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he knew not that the LORD had departed from him.\n",
      "But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.\n",
      "However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.\n",
      "Then the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.\n",
      "And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country; who slew many of us.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.\n",
      "And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars upon which the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.\n",
      "Now the house was full of men and women: and all the lords of the Philistines were there: and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.\n",
      "And Samson called to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.\n",
      "And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was supported, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.\n",
      "And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.\n",
      "Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.\n",
      "And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.\n",
      "And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst curse, and speak of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.\n",
      "And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to thee.\n",
      "Yet he restored the money to his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.\n",
      "And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\n",
      "And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.\n",
      "And the man departed out of the city from Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.\n",
      "And Micah said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.\n",
      "And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.\n",
      "And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.\n",
      "And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.\n",
      "Then said Micah, Now I know that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite for my priest.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day all their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their borders, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to explore the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.\n",
      "When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?\n",
      "And he said to them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.\n",
      "And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.\n",
      "And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way in which ye go.\n",
      "Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were in it, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.\n",
      "And they came to their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said to them, What say ye?\n",
      "And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.\n",
      "When ye go, ye shall come to a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is on the earth.\n",
      "And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.\n",
      "And they went up, and encamped in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim.\n",
      "And they passed thence to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.\n",
      "Then answered the five men that went to explore the country of Laish, and said to their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.\n",
      "And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and saluted him.\n",
      "And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.\n",
      "And the five men that went to explore the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.\n",
      "And these went into Micah\\'s house, and brought the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest to them, What do ye?\n",
      "And they said to him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: Is it better for thee to be a priest to the house of one man, or that thou shouldst be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?\n",
      "And the priest\\'s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.\n",
      "So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, and the cattle, and the furniture before them.\n",
      "And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah\\'s house were collected, and overtook the children of Dan.\n",
      "And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?\n",
      "And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye have gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say to me, What aileth thee?\n",
      "And the children of Dan said to him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows rush upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.\n",
      "And the children of Dan departed: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.\n",
      "And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.\n",
      "And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built a city and dwelt in it.\n",
      "And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: but the name of the city was Laish at the first.\n",
      "And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.\n",
      "And they set up for themselves Micah\\'s graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.\n",
      "And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite dwelling on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.\n",
      "And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father\\'s house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there four whole months.\n",
      "And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father\\'s house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.\n",
      "And his father-in-law, the damsel\\'s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they ate and drank, and lodged there.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he arose to depart: and the damsel\\'s father said to his son-in-law, Comfort thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward depart.\n",
      "And they sat down, and ate and drank both of them together: for the damsel\\'s father had said to the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.\n",
      "And when the man rose to depart, his father-in-law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.\n",
      "And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel\\'s father said, Comfort thy heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they ate both of them.\n",
      "And when the man arose to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel\\'s father, said to him, Behold now the day draweth towards evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day is coming to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.\n",
      "But the man would not tarry that night, but he arose and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.\n",
      "And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in to this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.\n",
      "And his master said to him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.\n",
      "And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.\n",
      "And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.\n",
      "And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.\n",
      "And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening, who was also of mount Ephraim; and he dwelt in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjaminites.\n",
      "And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a way-faring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?\n",
      "And he said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-Judah towards the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Beth-lehem-judah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me into his house.\n",
      "Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing:\n",
      "And the old man said, Peace be with thee; however, let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.\n",
      "So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet and ate and drank.\n",
      "Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house on all sides, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.\n",
      "And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.\n",
      "Behold, here is my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.\n",
      "But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.\n",
      "Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man\\'s house where her lord was, till it was light.\n",
      "And her lord rose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshhold.\n",
      "And he said to her, Rise, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her upon an ass, and the man rose, and went to his place.\n",
      "And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the borders of Israel.\n",
      "And it was so, that all that saw it, said, There hath been no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came from the land of Egypt to this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.\n",
      "Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.\n",
      "(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?\n",
      "And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.\n",
      "And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.\n",
      "And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.\n",
      "Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.\n",
      "And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house:\n",
      "But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up by lot against it;\n",
      "And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch provisions for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.\n",
      "So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.\n",
      "And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?\n",
      "Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and banish evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel:\n",
      "But the children of Benjamin assembled out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.\n",
      "Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; every one could sling stones to a hair-breadth, and not miss.\n",
      "And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.\n",
      "And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.\n",
      "And the children of Israel rose in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.\n",
      "And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin came forth from Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.\n",
      "And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.\n",
      "(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)\n",
      "And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.\n",
      "And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.\n",
      "Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD.\n",
      "And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,\n",
      "And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver them into thy hand.\n",
      "And Israel set liers in wait around Gibeah.\n",
      "And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city to the highways.\n",
      "And all the men of Israel rose out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.\n",
      "And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe: but they knew not that evil was near them.\n",
      "And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword.\n",
      "So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjaminites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.\n",
      "And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke to rise from the city.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.\n",
      "But when the flame began to rise from the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the flame of the city ascended to heaven.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil had come upon them.\n",
      "Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them who came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.\n",
      "Thus they inclosed the Benjaminites on all sides, and chased them, and trod them down with ease over against Gibeah towards the sun-rising.\n",
      "And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.\n",
      "And they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.\n",
      "So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.\n",
      "But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.\n",
      "And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.\n",
      "Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.\n",
      "And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept bitterly;\n",
      "And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "And the children of Israel repented for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.\n",
      "How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD, that we will not give them of our daughters for wives?\n",
      "And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? and behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.\n",
      "For the people were numbered, and behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.\n",
      "And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.\n",
      "And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.\n",
      "And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably to them.\n",
      "And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.\n",
      "And the people repented for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?\n",
      "And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that have escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.\n",
      "But, we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.\n",
      "Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.\n",
      "Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go, and lie in wait in the vineyards;\n",
      "And see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.\n",
      "And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be favorable to them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give to them at this time, that ye should be guilty.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and repaired the cities and dwelt in them.\n",
      "And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went from thence every man to his inheritance.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\n",
      "Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to dwell in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.\n",
      "And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.\n",
      "And Elimelech Naomi\\'s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.\n",
      "And they took to themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.\n",
      "And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left by her two sons and her husband.\n",
      "Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.\n",
      "Wherefore she went forth from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.\n",
      "And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother\\'s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.\n",
      "The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.\n",
      "And they said to her, surely we will return with thee to thy people.\n",
      "And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? shall I bear more sons, that they may be your husbands?\n",
      "Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have a husband also to-night, and should also bear sons;\n",
      "Would ye wait for them till they should be grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.\n",
      "And they lifted up their voice, and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved to her.\n",
      "And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law hath gone back to her people, and to her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.\n",
      "And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:\n",
      "Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death shall part thee and me.\n",
      "When she saw that she was steadfastly resolved to go with her, then she left speaking to her.\n",
      "So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?\n",
      "And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.\n",
      "I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?\n",
      "So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley-harvest.\n",
      "And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband\\'s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.\n",
      "And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.\n",
      "And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her lot was to light on a part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.\n",
      "And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said to the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.\n",
      "Then said Boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?\n",
      "And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi from the country of Moab:\n",
      "And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.\n",
      "Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:\n",
      "Let thy eyes be on the field that they are reaping, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art thirsty go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.\n",
      "Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found grace in thy eyes, that thou shouldst take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?\n",
      "And Boaz answered and said to her, It hath fully been shown to me, all that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and hast come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.\n",
      "The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou hast come to trust.\n",
      "Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I am not like to one of thy handmaidens.\n",
      "And Boaz said to her, At meal-time come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left.\n",
      "And when she had risen to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:\n",
      "And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.\n",
      "So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out that which she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.\n",
      "And she took it, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her what she had reserved after she was satisfied.\n",
      "And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou labored? blessed be he that took knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man\\'s name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.\n",
      "And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our next kinsmen.\n",
      "And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.\n",
      "And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou shouldst go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.\n",
      "So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean to the end of barley-harvest and of wheat-harvest; and dwelt with her mother-in-law.\n",
      "Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?\n",
      "And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.\n",
      "Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor: but make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.\n",
      "And it shall be when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.\n",
      "And she said to her, All that thou sayest to me I will do.\n",
      "And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.\n",
      "And when Boaz had eaten and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down.\n",
      "And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and behold, a woman lay at his feet.\n",
      "And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.\n",
      "And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow young men, whether poor or rich.\n",
      "And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.\n",
      "And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: yet there is a kinsman nearer than I.\n",
      "Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman\\'s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.\n",
      "And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came to the floor.\n",
      "Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.\n",
      "And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.\n",
      "And she said, These six measures of barley he gave me; for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.\n",
      "Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou knowest how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he hath finished the thing this day.\n",
      "Then Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there: and behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.\n",
      "And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.\n",
      "And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, that has come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech\\'s:\n",
      "And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.\n",
      "Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.\n",
      "And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.\n",
      "Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for confirming all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.\n",
      "Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for thyself. So he drew off his shoe.\n",
      "And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech\\'s, and all that was Chilion\\'s and Mahlon\\'s, of the hand of Naomi.\n",
      "Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.\n",
      "And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that hath come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Beth-lehem:\n",
      "And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.\n",
      "So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.\n",
      "And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, who hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.\n",
      "And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thy old age: for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.\n",
      "And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became its nurse.\n",
      "And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,\n",
      "And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,\n",
      "And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,\n",
      "And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,\n",
      "And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.\n",
      "Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:\n",
      "And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.\n",
      "And this man went up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.\n",
      "And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:\n",
      "But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah; but the LORD had rendered her barren.\n",
      "And her adversary also provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because the LORD had made her barren.\n",
      "And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.\n",
      "Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?\n",
      "So Hannah rose after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.\n",
      "And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.\n",
      "And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth.\n",
      "Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.\n",
      "And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.\n",
      "And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drank neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.\n",
      "Count not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.\n",
      "Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.\n",
      "And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.\n",
      "And they rose in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.\n",
      "Wherefore it came to pass, when the time had arrived, after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.\n",
      "And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.\n",
      "But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.\n",
      "And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth to thee good; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him.\n",
      "And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.\n",
      "And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.\n",
      "And she said, O my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying to the LORD.\n",
      "For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:\n",
      "Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshiped the LORD there.\n",
      "And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.\n",
      "There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none besides thee: neither is there any rock like our God.\n",
      "Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.\n",
      "The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.\n",
      "They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children is become feeble.\n",
      "The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.\n",
      "The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.\n",
      "He raiseth the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD\\'S, and he hath set the world upon them.\n",
      "He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.\n",
      "The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.\n",
      "And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.\n",
      "Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.\n",
      "And the priest\\'s custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest\\'s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;\n",
      "And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.\n",
      "Also before they burnt the fat, the priest\\'s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.\n",
      "And if any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, No; but thou shalt give it to me now: and if not, I will take it by force.\n",
      "Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.\n",
      "But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.\n",
      "Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband, to offer the yearly sacrifice.\n",
      "And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee issue of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home.\n",
      "And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.\n",
      "Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.\n",
      "No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD\\'S people to transgress.\n",
      "If one man shall sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man shall sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.\n",
      "And the child Samuel continued to grow, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.\n",
      "And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh\\'s house?\n",
      "And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?\n",
      "Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?\n",
      "Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.\n",
      "Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father\\'s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.\n",
      "And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.\n",
      "And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall be to consume thy eyes, and to grieve thy heart: and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.\n",
      "And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.\n",
      "And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my Anointed for ever.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house, shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priest\\'s offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.\n",
      "And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.\n",
      "And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to grow dim, that he could not see;\n",
      "And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;\n",
      "That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.\n",
      "And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.\n",
      "And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.\n",
      "Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.\n",
      "And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.\n",
      "Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.\n",
      "And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.\n",
      "In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.\n",
      "For I have told him, that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.\n",
      "And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli\\'s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.\n",
      "And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD: and Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.\n",
      "Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said to thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou shalt hide any thing from me, of all the things that he said to thee.\n",
      "And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.\n",
      "And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.\n",
      "And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.\n",
      "And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.\n",
      "And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.\n",
      "And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why hath the LORD smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us from the hand of our enemies.\n",
      "So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.\n",
      "And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.\n",
      "And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.\n",
      "And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God hath come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.\n",
      "Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.\n",
      "Be strong, and acquit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: acquit yourselves like men, and fight.\n",
      "And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.\n",
      "And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.\n",
      "And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.\n",
      "And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the way-side watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.\n",
      "And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.\n",
      "Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.\n",
      "And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?\n",
      "And the messenger answered and said, Israel hath fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.\n",
      "And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law, and her husband were dead, she bowed herself, and travailed; for her pains came upon her.\n",
      "And about the time of her death, the women that stood by her said to her, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.\n",
      "And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory hath departed from Israel. (Because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.)\n",
      "And she said, The glory hath departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.\n",
      "And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer to Ashdod.\n",
      "When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.\n",
      "And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.\n",
      "And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD: and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshhold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.\n",
      "Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon\\'s house, tread on the threshhold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.\n",
      "But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod, and its borders.\n",
      "And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is severe upon us, and upon Dagon our god.\n",
      "They sent therefore, and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel thither.\n",
      "And it was so, that after they had carried it thither, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.\n",
      "Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.\n",
      "So they sent and convened all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.\n",
      "And the men that died not, were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.\n",
      "And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.\n",
      "And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us with what we shall send it to its place.\n",
      "And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass-offering: then ye will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.\n",
      "Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.\n",
      "Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory to the God of Israel: it may be he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.\n",
      "Why then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?\n",
      "Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch-cows on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:\n",
      "And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold which ye return to him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by its side; and send it away, that it may go.\n",
      "And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know, that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.\n",
      "And the men did so; and took two milch cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:\n",
      "And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.\n",
      "And the cows took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth-shemesh.\n",
      "And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.\n",
      "And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they cleaved the wood of the cart, and offered the cows a burnt-offering to the LORD.\n",
      "And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, in which were the jewels of gold, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to the LORD.\n",
      "And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.\n",
      "And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering to the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;\n",
      "And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities, and of country villages, even to the great stone of Abel, on which they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.\n",
      "And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and seventy men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.\n",
      "And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?\n",
      "And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and bring it up to you.\n",
      "And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and brought up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.\n",
      "And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods, and Ashtaroth, from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "Then the children of Israel put away Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.\n",
      "And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.\n",
      "And they assembled at Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and there said, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were assembled at Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the LORD our God for us, that he will save us from the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt-offering wholly to the LORD: and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.\n",
      "And as Samuel was offering the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.\n",
      "And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car.\n",
      "Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.\n",
      "So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the borders of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.\n",
      "And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the borders of it did Israel deliver from the hands of the Philistines: and there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.\n",
      "And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.\n",
      "And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.\n",
      "And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.\n",
      "Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.\n",
      "And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.\n",
      "Then all the elders of Israel assembled, and came to Samuel to Ramah,\n",
      "And said to him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.\n",
      "But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us: and Samuel prayed to the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.\n",
      "According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even to this day, by which they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to thee.\n",
      "Now therefore hearken to their voice: yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that will reign over them.\n",
      "And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king.\n",
      "And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some will run before his chariots.\n",
      "And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to till his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.\n",
      "And he will take your daughters to be confectioneries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.\n",
      "And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.\n",
      "And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.\n",
      "And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your most choice young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.\n",
      "He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye will be his servants.\n",
      "And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen for yourselves; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;\n",
      "That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.\n",
      "And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go ye every man to his city.\n",
      "Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a mighty man of power.\n",
      "And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a more handsome person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.\n",
      "And the asses of Kish, Saul\\'s father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.\n",
      "And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjaminites, but they found them not.\n",
      "And when they had come to the land of Zuf, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and be anxious for us.\n",
      "And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; it may be he can show us our way that we should go.\n",
      "Then said Saul to his servant, But behold, if we go, what shall we bring to the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?\n",
      "And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.\n",
      "(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)\n",
      "Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go: so they went to the city where the man of God was.\n",
      "And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?\n",
      "And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to-day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to-day in the high place:\n",
      "As soon as ye shall enter the city, ye will straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he cometh, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are invited. Now therefore go up: for about this time ye will find him.\n",
      "And they went up into the city: and when they had come into the city, behold, Samuel came out meeting them, to go up to the high place.\n",
      "Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,\n",
      "To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people from the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me.\n",
      "And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee! this same shall reign over my people.\n",
      "Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer\\'s house is.\n",
      "And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me to the high place; for ye shall eat with me to-day, and to-morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.\n",
      "And as for thy asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father\\'s house?\n",
      "And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjaminite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then speakest thou so to me?\n",
      "And Samuel took Saul, and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the chief place among them that were invited, who were about thirty persons.\n",
      "And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee.\n",
      "And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat; for to this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.\n",
      "And when they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.\n",
      "And they rose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Arise, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.\n",
      "And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may show thee the word of God.\n",
      "Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?\n",
      "When thou hast departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel\\'s sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?\n",
      "Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:\n",
      "And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive from their hands.\n",
      "After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou hast come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will prophesy:\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.\n",
      "And let it be, when these signs have come to thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.\n",
      "And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.\n",
      "And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.\n",
      "And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.\n",
      "And it came to pass when all that formerly knew him saw, that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that hath come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\n",
      "And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?\n",
      "And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.\n",
      "And Saul\\'s uncle said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.\n",
      "And Saul\\'s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, What Samuel said to you.\n",
      "And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he told him not.\n",
      "And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;\n",
      "And said to the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:\n",
      "And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities, and your tribulations; and ye have said to him, No, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.\n",
      "And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.\n",
      "When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.\n",
      "Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man would yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.\n",
      "And they ran and brought him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.\n",
      "And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.\n",
      "Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.\n",
      "And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.\n",
      "But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.\n",
      "Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.\n",
      "And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.\n",
      "And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days respit, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel: and then, if there is no man to save us, we will come out to thee.\n",
      "Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.\n",
      "And behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.\n",
      "And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.\n",
      "And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.\n",
      "And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.\n",
      "And they said to the messengers that came, thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.\n",
      "Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out to you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good to you.\n",
      "And it was so on the morrow, that Saul disposed the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning-watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they who remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.\n",
      "And the people said to Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.\n",
      "And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to-day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.\n",
      "Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.\n",
      "And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal: and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.\n",
      "And Samuel said to all Israel, behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all that ye said to me, and have made a king over you.\n",
      "And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood to this day.\n",
      "Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed; whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes with it? and I will restore it you.\n",
      "And they said thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught from any man\\'s hand.\n",
      "And he said to them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.\n",
      "And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.\n",
      "When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers from Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.\n",
      "And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.\n",
      "And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.\n",
      "And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you from the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt safe.\n",
      "And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.\n",
      "Now therefore, behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.\n",
      "If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye, and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God.\n",
      "But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.\n",
      "Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.\n",
      "Is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call to the LORD, and he will send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.\n",
      "So Samuel called to the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.\n",
      "And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.\n",
      "And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;\n",
      "And turn ye not aside: for then would ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.\n",
      "For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name\\'s sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.\n",
      "Moreover as for me, Far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:\n",
      "Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.\n",
      "But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye will be consumed, both ye and your king.\n",
      "Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,\n",
      "Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.\n",
      "And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba; and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.\n",
      "And all Israel heard it said that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines: and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.\n",
      "And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.\n",
      "When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed) then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.\n",
      "And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.\n",
      "And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.\n",
      "And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt-offering to me, and peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.\n",
      "And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled at Michmash;\n",
      "Therefore said I, the Philistines will now come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD; I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt-offering.\n",
      "And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.\n",
      "But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.\n",
      "And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.\n",
      "And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.\n",
      "And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leadeth to Ophrah, to the land of Shual:\n",
      "And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim towards the wilderness.\n",
      "Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: (for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:)\n",
      "But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his colter, and his ax, and his mattock.\n",
      "Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the colters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.\n",
      "So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.\n",
      "And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.\n",
      "Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.\n",
      "And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;\n",
      "And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod\\'s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD\\'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.\n",
      "And between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.\n",
      "The front of the one was situated northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.\n",
      "And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.\n",
      "And his armor-bearer said to him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.\n",
      "Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to these men, and we will discover ourselves to them.\n",
      "If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.\n",
      "But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand; and this shall be a sign to us.\n",
      "And both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.\n",
      "And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.\n",
      "And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor-bearer slew after him.\n",
      "And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half-acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.\n",
      "And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.\n",
      "And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.\n",
      "Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.\n",
      "And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.\n",
      "And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on, and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.\n",
      "And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and behold, every man\\'s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.\n",
      "Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp from the country around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.\n",
      "Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.\n",
      "So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over to Beth-aven.\n",
      "And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.\n",
      "And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.\n",
      "And when the people had come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.\n",
      "But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in a honey-comb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.\n",
      "Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.\n",
      "Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.\n",
      "How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?\n",
      "And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon: and the people were very faint.\n",
      "And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people ate them with the blood.\n",
      "Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone to me this day.\n",
      "And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.\n",
      "And Saul built an altar to the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD:\n",
      "And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seemeth good to thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither to God.\n",
      "And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.\n",
      "And Saul said, Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.\n",
      "For as the LORD liveth, who saveth Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.\n",
      "Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seemeth good to thee.\n",
      "Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.\n",
      "And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.\n",
      "Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand, and, lo, I must die.\n",
      "And Saul answered, God do so, and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.\n",
      "And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? By no means: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.\n",
      "Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.\n",
      "So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he harassed them.\n",
      "And he gathered a host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of them that spoiled them.\n",
      "Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:\n",
      "And the name of Saul\\'s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul\\'s uncle.\n",
      "And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel."
