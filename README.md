## The Bible Natural Language Processing Project
by Jeremy Steele and Jared Reser

<p> This project examines two different bible translation; <i> The King James Version </i> and <i> American Standard</i>. </p>
<p> We will run the two translations through a python Natural Language Processor's sentiment analysis. </p>
<p> With the sentiment analysis report, we can statistically prove how similar the bible versions are and find passages that are strikingly different. </p>


We want to cite: https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases for the data.
