<p> This project examines two different bible translation; <i> The King James Version </i> and <i> American Standard </i>. </p>
We will run the two translations through a python Natural Language Processor's sentiment analysis.<br> 
With the sentiment analysis report, we can statistically prove how similar the bible versions are and find passages that are strikingly different.<br>


We want to cite: https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases for the data.
