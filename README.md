## The Bible Natural Language Processing Project
by Jeremy Steele and Jared Reser

<p> This project examines seven different bible translations.</p>
<p> We ran a sentiment analyzer using the TextBlob python library on every chapter in every version of the bible. </p>
<p> With the sentiment analysis report, we can statistically prove how similar the bible versions are and find passages that are strikingly different. </p>


We want to cite: https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases for the data.
