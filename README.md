#### bible-nlp

This project examines two different bible translation; <i> The King James Version </i> and <i> American Standard </i>. 
We will run the two translations through a python Natural Language Processor's sentiment analysis.
With the sentiment analysis report, we can statistically prove how similar the bible versions are and find passages that are strikingly different.


We want to cite: https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases for the data.
